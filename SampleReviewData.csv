In the great pork bun debate, I vote for Ippudo. Sorry Momofuku.   Definitely not the place for an intimate date, but the atmosphere is great. There are several larger tables/bars so you may be sitting next to people you don't know, and the hostesses, waiters and chefs yell all kinds of things at random, but I think that adds to the ambiance. The service has been friendly, attentive and quick every time. The wait can be intimidating, sometimes 2-3 hours, but it's worth it. Put your name in a couple of hours before you actually want to eat, wander around the East Village or go around the corner to Black and White Bar and get a couple of drinks. They are super nice and you can call back and check your status on the wait list. Seriously one of my favorite restaurants in the city.",9,7,7,6

3,68445,555,5/13/13,"I really don't understand why this place is rated so high.  I am a native New Yorker, this truck has been here for years and the quality in my opinion is getting worse.  One of the things that has happened in recent years in the food is no longer really prepared on site, much of it is brought in my van and warmed up in the cart, and I don't think its as good as some of the other carts in the area.  Typically I go to the one on 49 or 50th on 6th ave, because the quality is better there, and you dont have to wait on line with some of the drunkest and stupidest people in the world for an hour just to get cart food.",2,4,1,5
4,99410,247,4/22/13,"Thank god they take down your phone number so you don't have to wait with a 100 other people in the front bar area. With waits times hours long you could go watch a movie if you plan it right. Sat at the dining bar, and enjoyed watching the chefs do their stuff. I had the porky ramen, but found the pork belly a little over cooked. I did really like the cucumber appetizer. Something about the ratio of their sesame oil and salt and the freshness of the cucumber was super good.",5,6,7,8
5,90106,452,3/23/13,We saw the B rating on the door...we should have followed our first instincts. I ordered the hanger steak..basically 3 meatballs on a pile of mushrooms with French fries under to make ot look big...for $30..my lady ordered the grilled sea bass..it had the grill marks but was cool inside..hmmm for $30. The waiters were nice though.,5,7,3,6
6,41581,335,6/25/13,"this place was great.  I've tried about every taco, even the specialty tacos, which sound weird but are delicious.  This place could definitely be compared to some good taco shops in Arizona and California.  The prices are very reasonable.  I would definitely go back.",8,6,7,5
7,94037,465,1/6/12,"The pizza was okay.  Not anywhere near what the reputation would suggest.  Contrary to what I've read here, the service was actually very nice.  The real disappointment was when it came time to pay the bill.  Cash only, so I hit the ATM.  $4.50 fee!? I've never in my Manhattan/Brooklyn life seen a fee this high. No thank you. I asked the waiter if there was anywhere else to get cash in the area.  He said he had no idea.  He said they had nothing to do with the ATM, which is perhaps only very technically true at best.  I was tempted to tell him his tip just went into the ATM - he could retrieve it there.  Instead I am leaving a review here.  Restaurants should be held accountable for this kind of thing. Instead of leaving Grimaldi's grateful for a decent pizza, I left mad about a stupid ATM fee.  Will not go back out of principle.",7,5,5,4
8,15150,685,8/11/13,"I don't think I can ever have any other burger ever again. Umami Burger blows any other burger I've ever had out of the water. You have no idea how excited I was when I heard New York was finally getting our very own Umami Burger. During all this hype of the grand opening, I only had to wait 30 minutes for a table of two, but I've heard larger groups being asked to wait for an hour, which isn't TOO bad. I definitely think it's worth the wait. The whole idea of umami is the 5th taste -  savory. I honestly had no idea it would be this good. With my bf, I split the manly burger, truffle burger, and truffle fries - truffle all day, everyday.  The truffle burger was my favorite, and this is the burger i've been waiting for my whole life. Listen to the waiter's suggestion and get it MEDIUM RARE! It's soft, juicy, and full of flavor. It's so savory it makes your mouth water even while you're still eating it. The umami ketchup they give is really great, and the perfect compliment as well. The manly burger was good too and so were the fries, but I wish they were cut in thicker slices or gave more! I finished those babies in no time! But if I'm wishing for things, I would want bigger portions of everything there. I can't wait to go back and order something off their secret menu. I've heard of other creations such as the kalbi burger, duck burger, and b.u.b burger. I will be back!",9,9,8,8

10,146950,819,5/9/11,"A very fun ambiance, the place is always jam packed.  A lot of energy, lively and trendy. It's one of a few restaurants that resides in the basement and still draws a crowd. Not a sushi place, but the cooked food/small dishes was pretty good. The price was decent for a time square location.  I haven't find something signature on the menu that makes me crave and drives me to go back though. I have spent a few nights having good time with friends at the restaurant. I would definitely go again when I'm in the area, just that the wait can be insane at times, and the people there were nice enough not to really rush you once you get seated...at least that's how I remembered it =)",7,8,8,6
11,1222,145,7/16/14,"Very nice pizza slice, price $ 4 or 4.50 but I guess in this City you can't excape from high prices... I would cut the slice a bit larger at least! Enjoy. Ps. Maybe the slice is so expensive so you buy a whole pizza which might be worth?! I'll think about it.",4,5,6,3
12,42922,480,6/6/12,"Big fan, beautiful space, very sweet manager, Brandy, who came over and chatted a bit with me and my date.  We only had wine (the rose and albarino were both great), but I'll be back for sure.",9,5,6,7
13,32577,100,4/12/14,"Super tiny restaurant and very popular. Prepare to stand in line to get in. Food was good, not amazing so I'm not entirely sure why it's so hip.

15,21525,72,6/13/13,"Hands down, the best ramen I've had in NYC by far. The Spicy Miso Ramen is DELICIOUS. The spice is perfect, gives it a little kick but definitely not so bad that I was sweating into my soup. This is my new go-to ramen spot, can't wait to come back!",8,6,8,8
16,29290,542,9/14/11,"Over rated for new york thin crust pizza. The sauce tasted like it was from a can. The cheese was good tho. Caesar salad and bruschetta was good too, the only reason I gave it the third star. Overall I would never go back or take anyone else to this restaurant. There are many other places you can get authentic New York Pizza in New York!",4,5,4,2
17,45554,422,6/15/13,"Really tasty, satisfying food. Standard selection of Americanized Mexican food (e.g. tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tostada salads), but good ingredients and great flavor. Big selection of vegetarian burritos (and vegan adaptations available) that have, in tandem with the great taste, won my heart. Seitan burrito? Yes please. Lots of tasty hot sauces and salsas (and guacamole, if you order it) to go with whatever you're getting. Quick delivery or takeout. There are a few stool seats in the place if you happen to drop by and want to eat in, but this is only doable if you're alone or with one other person.",8,6,7,5
18,3457,709,4/28/13,"Excellent! My friend and I were looking for a place to eat before an event at The Bell House. We had originally picked somewhere else, but when we walked pack this place with its outdoor seating and cute red umbrellas and ADORABLE old-fashioned decor and ceiling tiles inside, how could we turn it down? The menu was great. The sandwiches and sides and salads all looked incredible (they also have pizza and pasta and bruschetta). I had chosen a panini, and then our waiter told us the special - butternut squash and coconut soup. YEP, I'll take a bowl! I also ordered a side of the house potato chips. You guys, they were SO good! They were ultra crispy and not greasy in the slightest! They were lightly coated in this great salt; it was flakes instead of granules. Nummy. The soup was sooooo good, too. Normally, butternut squash soup gets boring after a few spoonfuls, but this one left me happy till the last drop. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend!",9,9,9,9
19,110014,549,7/13/14,"This is a great spot to grab a coffee and catch up with a friend. Casual, friendly vibe. My friend has eaten there often and recommended the food, however, I have to give three stars because I got the heart of palm and chicken salad and the lettuce ends were disappointingly brown. I didn't want to make a big deal because I was short on time so can't comment on the customer service (which was great during the ordering process), but I had to toss almost half of my salad away. Sadness :(",4,5,3,5
20,61647,263,8/30/10,"After seeing Scott Conant on Top Chef, Chopped and No Reservations, I finally had a chance to dine with friends at Scarpetta.  My friends arrived early so they went across the street to grab a drink.  The host and hostess at Scarpetta allowed us to push our reservation back half an hour so we could go across the street for a drink first.  Very accommodating. The dinner didn't disappoint.  The bread basket was wonderful.  I agree with other Yelpers that the salami stuffed bread was amazing.  We shared the burrata and fritto misto to start.  Both were perfection.  The fritto misto was light and how can you go wrong with fried flavors! For main course, I had the agnolotti which was one of the best italian pasta dishes that I've ever had.  Each little pocket of pasta burst with flavor.  It was truly a wonderful dish. I would definitely return again but I think it is a bit pricey.  Shared apps, entrees, coffee/tea and one glass of wine ran us about $60/head with tax and tip.",9,3,9,1
21,144980,796,12/3/12,"The food is good. You won't feel full or like you had an outterbody experience, but you will be satisfied. The brunch cocktails are amazing! Great selection of bourbon if you're into that. The food came out quickly and tasted good. Service was lacking. Our waiter was completely uninterested in our table or if we were taken care of. I don't know if he was having a bad day, or that's just him. I went one time before and the service much better. So I guess just hope you get a cheerful server :)",5,4,5,4
22,91293,454,10/22/10,sometimes i go to lucky chang's and drink too much and decide a trip to cafeteria would be a nice end to my evening but what ends up happening is that i overhear an engagement proposal happening at the table to my right and instead of smiling and tipping my hat/ raising my glass to the newly engaged i jump up on my egg-shaped ottoman/chair/incubee and start announcing to the entire downstairs diningroom that WE HAVE AN ENGAGED COUPLE OVER HERE AND A CELEBRATION IS IN ORDER and then i start a round of applause and a wave and demand that everyone send them drinks so they have about 20 drinks on their table for two people and then my friends and i decide to join them at their massive table for two and over the next couple hours and two different bars we talk about how we will totally be in the wedding party... we. never. talk. again.,6,9,5,7
23,11809,524,12/23/13,"Within a year, Mighty Quinn's has become a neighborhood favorite.  And I'm not just talking about myself.  Hundreds of low and slow faithful line up out the door and down the street night after night, regardless of the weather.   Taking a page from the BBQ handbook, you order meat by weight and seat yourself.  Sorry, no fancy table service here.  Be prepared to sit with strangers as the seating is tight.  Introverts need not fear; you will be shoveling the food down so fast, you won't feel the need to make small talk with your neighbors.   I'm not really a BBQ sandwich kind of guy myself.  Just give me the meat and save the filler.  For those of you who enjoy the bread, you have that option here and I'm sure it's just as amazing.  The menu highlights were definitely the fatty brisket and the burnt ends.  I would have preferred a little less sauce on the burnt ends but they were still phenomenal and I couldn't stop eating them.  The fatty brisket rivaled Hill Country although I still think Hill Country takes the cake in that department.  Still, here at MQ's it was melt in your mouth good and you didn't want to stop eating it.  The ribs definitely left something to be desired.  They were a little dry and required extra sauce.  (See: Daisy May's for the OG ribs).  As for sides, sweet potato casserole all the way. Encountered a very surly ""server"" here who I wanted to b*tch slap but her Aunt Flo was probably in town for the week so I did as my man Jesus did and turned the other cheek.  I'm not even sure what her job was since you seat yourself/bus your own tray and the people behind the counter get your food.  She was pretty much a bouncer, ensuring an orderly line, but don't you dare ask her how long the wait is from a certain point.  God help you if you ask her that... Other than that encounter, very enjoyable experience here.  Top notch BBQ is just what the East Village needed.",7,5,7,6
24,55062,227,1/30/13,Seriously delectable food. Excellent service. Yummy cocktails. We couldn't stop gushing over  the food though.,8,6,8,6
25,20669,677,12/22/14,"It's nothing to look at, but the food is an old comfort here. It's counter style ordering at its finest, patrons rubbing elbows with one another on line, damp plastic trays stacked up high, steaming metal trays of food steaming deliciously. Ordering is an ordeal here, and I was chided at least once for not ""following their order procedure"" -- for example: how was I to know you need to pick up a tray if you order in? But once I sat down at my table, tray laden full of Dominican food in front of me, I instantly forgot the bustle and calamity I had to endure to get there. Oxtail melted off the bone, just barely, but just enough. The sauce was slightly too thick and salty for my liking, but the flavor was delicious. A chicken stew thickened with disintegrating potatoes reminded me of cheap hole-in-the-wall taquerias on late nights throughout my college days. A platter of rice, beans, and plantains heaped so heavily that sudden motions during the transportation of tray-to-table would result in floods of food all over the place. The food definitely sticks to your ribs and you feel it after your meal. But it's good. You get a lot of food for your money and you'll probably swear never to come back, but I guarantee you will eventually. It has a sort of quaint charm (for midtown Manhattan) that does it. Pros: Food is decent Huge portions Pretty cheap Cons: Cafeteria style seating Can be a bit of a zoo with all the people on line ordering and shouting Feels claustrophobic",6,5,7,6
26,18777,840,5/29/11,It's a 4 but knocked it to 3 for the most recent visit. My waiter was ok...and if he were a bit better that night I would keep this place as a 4. I had a friend visit from jersey and met here based on my experience before and i won't again probably. :(  it's so sad because i really went here a lot and was embarassed by my last visit.,3,6,2,6
27,2446,564,9/15/13,"Like just about everyone else who has reviewed Amelie, I concur that the $10 wine flights during the 5-7 pm happy hour is a really excellent deal. Fairly generous pours, and if you're a wine connoisseur, feel free to choose any three wines as long as they're all different. My server was a very gregarious Spanish man who was extremely helpful with the group. He gave us lots of bread refills and wasn't in a hurry to have us leave even though we lingered over 3 hours. The seats at the larger tables looked like cinema seats - they had numbers and the bottom of the seat would flip up when you stood. I tried the goat cheese balls and the escargots - unfortunately none were too memorable, but it was a suitable accompaniment to the excellent deal on the wine. There was a live jazz band performing as well.",7,2,7,2
28,89241,448,3/17/14,"Went here on a Sunday during brunch hours. It was really busy and so we ended up waiting a little while for our food--about 25 minutes, so nothing absurd. When we got our food, a guy who I assume must have been the manager came over and said that he noticed we had to wait for a while and offered us a round of free drinks by way of apology. It was great, proactive customer service. Also, the food was delicious.",8,2,8,3
29,26135,289,3/12/10,"One of the better falafels I have had in NYC, but...... just not complex enough, and a little too dry (not Mamoun dry though). I do like the fact that they have 3 different types of falafel, but for $6 I feel there should be a little more complexity to the ingredients used in the sandwich, they could pick up a few tips from Azuri Cafe. They are friendly and do a good job at getting you what you want when they are busy, and they do get busy, recommend calling your order in if you are going to pick up around lunch, otherwise you might stand there for a good 15 minutes with no where to stand inside, or sit outside.",6,2,7,2
30,4535,490,8/11/12,"Visited Bouley twice in the past 2 weeks. Overall I think the food, service and atmosphere is certainly comparable to, if not better than, most of the many top tier restaurants I've been to in NY and around the world. Some of my absolute favs at Bouley is the pre-dessert white peach soup with icecream (I don't think they have this anymore), the porcini flan with crab, and the duck. The bread service is also extremely good. I've also had some of the more creative (El Bulli inspired) off menu items such as the white chocolate ""cloud"". On top of the food, the service was superb (I had Carlos on both visits) and the atmosphere is lovely. Most restaurants fail to impress the second time due to the loss of the surprise factor, but Bouley was superb on both visits. Will definitely go back again next time when I'm back in NY.",8,3,9,7
31,61398,263,12/23/13,"Scott Conant delivers at Scarpetta. What a gem this restaurant is. Situated on the outskirts of the meat packing district on 14th Street, you could easily have trouble finding the restaurant. The grey sign with light yellow writing is small and obscure to say the least! But the word is out because this place is always packed and this last Saturday night was no different. We dined here with another couple and were seated quite promptly after ordering some wine and a cocktail at the bar. A note on good bar tender service: I wasn't sure about the white wine by the glass he suggested so he gave me a taste I could swirl around and consider before ordering. These small details make such a difference in service. In fact, at dinner I ordered a different glass and without prompting, the server also allowed me to taste it before filling my glass. Both wines were delicious. Try not to fill up on the unbelievably indulgent bread they served before the meal. The dough is rolled with cheese, prosciutto and spinach which makes this bread practically a meal in itself. I passed on an appetizer but tasted my husband's octopus which was so tasty-the smoke flavor, chick peas and pancetta made this little dish sing! Our friends shared the short ribs app and also reported it to be excellent. I had the fennel dusted cod which was cooked to perfection and served with an unbelievably seasoned ragout and a baccala pur√©e that was out of this world. Salted cod pur√©e?! Genius Mr. Conant! Hubby had the a seafood tagliolini and he is a tough critic on homemade pasta-well, this tasted pretty close to what you might expect in Italy. Service was attentive and my glass was flowing throughout the meal with pellegrino as ordered. Coffee was really superb and they steam the milk which I think is the sign of after-dinner coffee service perfection! The group shared the banana bread dessert which really was outstanding. Beautifully plated and flavors really worked for a nicely composed dessert-and large enough to share. We never felt rushed even though we sat at 7:15 and left around 9:15. Service was also exceptional. Atmosphere is trendy but not obnoxious and over the top. The decor is simple but it works in the space. The only weird thing to note is the creepy basement location of the bathrooms which have a communal row of sinks for hand washing and they are tucked into the ladies area. It is just a little weird to be fixing your hair or freshening your makeup next to the gents! Other than that, absolutely perfect dining experience and not outrageously priced either. Definitely returning soon!",8,1,9,7
32,7336,711,4/8/13,"This place is jam packed! My friend and I went for something small and then came back here for round two. I recommend coming here at a later time, we got seats in 15 mins as oppose to 30+ mins. (**) I say sit at the bar since the bartenders were really the people who took orders and you can watch the game at the same time. The place was nice with dim lighting. Good for groups, dates, and hang out. I don't recommend coming here just to drink at the bar because there was no room for it. It was mainly occupied by customer who eat. (***) Before I started my meal, the waiter helped us with our bibs and gave us plastic gloves. What came after was all the good stuff which was also in plastic bags. This is where I can truly say ""dig in"". I had 1LB of the Shrimp and 1LB of the clam with mild sauce and all the spicy they use. It had this thickness of cheese and they used a lot of garlic. It was very salty, but at the same time it taste so good. (***) Service was a bit slow in the beginning since it took us forever to figure out who can take our order, but then it started picking up when our food came. The waiters were like owls, they could spot every empty bag and remove it from your table just like that. I love how the waitress called us ""love"" whenever we needed something. It works for her so keep it up. When we left the restaurant, the owner would greet us like we were entering. (****)",8,9,6,7
33,13778,43,7/23/10,"Love Cookshop. Love the ambiance, decor, drinks, and most of all, the food. Their brunch is one of the best brunches I've ever had in the city, no doubt. The cookshop scramble with salmon is just so scrumptious that I don't know what they do to their eggs... I've tried to replicate it many times, but their eggs are just magical. Their pancakes and french toast are deelish as well, and a plus for summer: there's outdoors seating. Dinner is great, too - but a tad on the expensive side for me.",8,5,7,7
34,13791,215,2/10/10,"Not too much space (and even less when everyone's coats and other winter gear is piled up on the seats) - but the atmosphere and the food definitely made up for it. Fried pickles - why would you want to fry a pickle? (Why do we fry anything, for that matter?! Because it'll taste damn good.) Slightly spicy, but not too much to handle. Sweet Afton's burger - actually tasted like a steak burger, yum. I'm jealous that Astoria gets this fun little spot all to itself.",8,7,7,7

Marge: And this? Manjula: Chickpeas and lentils Apu: Try it with the rice! Anyhoo, that was reminiscent of our dinner at Osteria Morini. What's in this? Cream, butter, and proscuitto. And what's in this? Cream, butter, and proscuitto. That being said, the 3 are a winning combo, and while dabbing cream and butter onto pasta isn't culinary genius (and probably not worth a $22 price tag), it did make for satisfying eating on a recent subzero NYC night.",8,3,8,3
36,83499,414,2/19/11,"It never gets old. I live around the corner and have meatballs maybe three times a week. A lot of great restaurants I find I feel very enthusiastically about at first, but continually visiting takes away the value, however the meatball shop is consistently amazing. Maybe its because the concept is so simple, and yet there is so much variety. Whatever it is, it certainly works for me (i wait like a hawk at the bar ready to swoop down and grab seats so as not to wait for an hour!).",9,3,9,3
37,10154,497,9/9/12,"Other reviews do a great job but here is some more advice: BYOB (free corkage)! It's really hard to find a BYOB that has amazing food in NYC. We didn't know this before we went but the waitress directed us to a wine shop at S 1st and Bedford. It was hard to find something to go with both Korean and French flavors but our Montepulciano d'Abruzzo did the trick. It's a small space so try to make reservations. The dining area maybe sits 9 people inside and a couple outside; apparently the restaurant started out as a take-out place but people started eating there and now it also has dine-in. You get a sense the delivery is still a huge part of the business because they had as much staff as diners when I went! In addition to the Kimchi Bouillabaisse (more mussels than other seafood but still delish), also try the duck confit, which was super tasty. The greens that came with the duck has a pomegranate dressing that served as the perfect compliment.",7,4,7,4

The food is severely sub par. I suppose if it was continually empty, it might be cute to pop into every once in awhile and get a drink but generally speaking you might as well just move to europe to hang out with the euro trash if you enjoy this place that much.",2,7,2,7
39,8913,243,12/5/10,The food is worth the sometimes long wait and average service.

Ordered my 2 eggs with pancakes and got my pancake fix. I was quite hungry but couldn't finish everything cuz those pancakes were seriously huge. Big and fluffy pancakes - I can eat them everyday. It was cheap too. Came out about 8$ with coffee. Took my husband there on the weekend and the place was full (it was fleet week). So we sat down at the back at a table. My husband had the curious George (which is eggs, cheese, bacon and French fries in a sandwich) and I had the Greek fajitas. His curious George was sooo awesome - but don't forget the hot sauce! The fajitas was a-ok. Only problem though - my husband's tummy got sick after we got home - I took 1 star off because of that. I will keep going there to get my pancake fix and/ or when I'm too lazy to cook breakfast. I'm so glad we have johny's in the neighborhood!",9,7,9,7

For $8 I got a delicious, huge bowl of curry with a perfectly crispy katsu, and delicious fukujinzuke pickles.  Not an overwhelming amount of rice, just enough, and perfectly balanced.  Comes with a nice side of shredded cabbage. My friend and I laughed as we ate that the restaurant was perfectly authentic and reminiscent of our time in Japan because of how tiny it was, really just a counter and 4 tightly packed little tables, we were basically sitting on top of the people next to us, so if you hate tight spaces get takeout!",7,8,9,8
43,7551,919,12/4/12,"Unfortunately  my niece was recently diagnosed with Celiac's Disease.  So when my entire family came into the city we felt it would be best to eat at a legit gluten-free restaurant.  I'll be honest, I'm kind of a food snob and was nervous we wouldn't find a decent place.   There didn't seem to be many legit options either. Lots of places say they can make gluten-free to order but they kind of don't know what they are talking about.   Upon researching different options I stumbled upon Bistango.  Though it's outside of midtown (Murray Hill, what?!) and we were seeing a show in the Theater District at 8pm, I decided the reviews were good enough to go off the grid and take my family on an adventure to Murray Hill.  ...and I'm SO glad I did! Anthony is the owner of the restaurant and couldn't be a nicer guy.  He was very helpful when I made the phone reservation, even told me the history on the hows and whys Bistango made the switch to gluten-free food options. The food is delicious.  Whether or not you need to eat gluten-free you will really love the food.  I had the skirt steak and think it was possibly the best skirt steak that I've ever had.   Creme Brulee for dessert.  Calamari   appetizer, tuna tar tar.... I have to say, I would totally go back.  Great service, great food.  If you're looking for a great gluten-free option (or even if you're not!!!) you won't be disappointed.",9,6,9,7
44,89515,448,3/11/11,I love this place. It's kitchy and has really good food. The only downside is that there's usually a serious wait during peak hours. It's way too popular. I wish people would stop liking it.,8,7,7,7
45,74753,601,12/10/08,"The field of NYC pizza reviewing is so rife with contention that it's all but impossible to get any perspective.  We're all a bit pizza nuts and get trapped in the polemical loop circling what constitutes ""the best"". Are we as strongly opinionated about any other food in this city?  I suppose we feel in some strange way that NYC pizza belongs to us, or stems from us, or is us...a kind of food proxy; hence all the heated debate. Anyway, where does Luzzo's stand in the fray?  I've eaten here several times and it has oscillated from very good (3 stars) to outstanding (5 stars) depending largely on whether the resident pizzaiolo is manning the ship.   On their outstanding days, the pizza comes out of that blazing coal fired oven in 2 minutes flat.  As you bite in the crust gives off a puff of steam (the rapid bake time traps the moisture).  There is just a smattering of char on the base to add that subtle carbon twang.  The sauce, the cheese, everything tastes so bright and articulate; it is just barely cooked and has yet to dissipate an ounce of intrinsic flavor.  Utterly ethereal!   If you wait more than 5 minutes, it is a soggy mess of disjointed flavors.  More than any other dish, this hinges on timing for the pizza you start with bares little resemblance to that which you are ingesting at the meal's conclusion. As for the service, what can anyone say?  It possesses that rare continental combination of aggressive and inattentive - polarities fostered in countries devoid of tipping.",7,5,5,5
46,30615,685,7/29/13,"I feel like I have had almost every burger in NYC that claims to be the ""best"" and it has been a long time since a burger has blown me away....until today.  I had the day off so I made my way over to Umami for a late lunch, early dinner around 4PM.  The wait was about 25-30 minutes and when we got inside the staff was incredibly friendly. Our waitress was great and even though the restaurant opened today she had tried every burger and was able to give me information on each one.  Her favorite was the Truffle burger so I decided to go with that one.  As other reviewers have said, they recommend getting the burger medium rare.  The burger came out in about 10 minutes and it was AMAZING.  Every bite was perfect and I was sad as it started to get smaller and smaller.  It probably was the most rare ""medium rare"" I have ever had but it still stayed together as I ate it.  We also had the sweet potato fries with the 4 dipping sauces.  The fries were good but no different then other good fries you can get anywhere.  I can't wait to come back again and again although I can't imagine anything else on the menu being as good as the truffle burger.",7,3,9,8
47,11988,860,6/10/08,"I never realized how much I had gotten sick NY style pizza till I ate at Adrienne's (tied with Aperitivo because their pizza is near identical). This is probably on my list of top 3 pizza places in the city. While it was depressing working in the financial district, on those occasions I had enough time to leave my desk to eat out, Adrienne's was my first choice spot. Introduced by an ex-colleague, the pizza here is delicious. But if you're into the traditonally thin and triangular, larger-than-life size slices of NY style pizza, then this isn't the place for you. The pizza at Adrienne's, if you order a whole pie, comes out in a retangular pan. I think regardless of the toppings you get (my favorite combo is onions, roasted peppers, mushrooms and prosciutto), the pizza will taste marvelous. I like it because it's a little more substantive than the regular NY style pizza, but much less dense and bready than sicilian pizza. They bake the pizza with perfection so there's that wonderful ""crunch"" when you take a bite. The pizza bread on the inside isn't doughy--it's baked with just the right amount of fluffiness and the tomato sauce to cheese ratio is just right. And so is the amount of toppings. During lunch, it's impossible to get a table or seat, especially during the winter. When it gets warmer outside, they open up seating on the cobblestone and the ambiance is nice. Definitely swing by if you're in the area, you won't be sorry! I crave Adrienne's every now and then and it's definitely irritating because I no longer work or live close by!",6,3,7,6

The bar staff is wonderful and attentive, the music fun, and the decor fabulous. It has the ambiance of a speakeasy, although I imagine it's not as calm during happy hour times after work. It also has a great scotch selection, which is always a plus in my book. I only had the pleasure of trying their Pie du Jour, which was nice and hearty, perfect comfort food on a chilly day.

50,78972,628,11/4/13,"I give Morgan's two stars in hopes that in a month or two I can go back and then add a few more stars. I went for brunch with three friends and they came to sit us as we were still perusing the menu and deciding whether or not we wanted to eat there. We decided to go for it, but upon sitting down we were promptly told that the regular brunch menu was not an option. Instead they gave one piece of paper with all new brunch items. Unfortunately, some of the stuff that was on the original brunch menu was what we had wanted, but we figured we'd make do. The waitress (who was a bit weird) came to take our drink orders. I had seen a bloody mary go by and asked how much they were since they weren't listed on the menu. She said she didn't know but that she ""thought"" they were $9. The one I'd seen was tiny, so there was no way I was going to get it. My friend ordered coffee, but was promptly told they didn't have coffee. Who serves brunch and doesn't have coffee?? We ordered food and it came pretty quickly. Nothing was hot though, which was unfortunate because the flavors were there it was just too cold. I got the biscuits and gravy with the mushroom gravy. Really yummy gravy, but the biscuits were too dense. I grew up in the south and know what biscuits should taste like, and these were not that. I also split a side of mac and cheese with a friend. It was fine, but nothing special, and again it was almost cold which is not good for mac and cheese. My other friends liked their food... one got a breakfast burrito and said the brisket was delicious. Another got a large plate of banana pancakes, which were good (although there was nutella on the top, which I don't think he was expecting). The third got a sandwich and had to order a side of mac and cheese bc they only serve sides with their sandwiches M-F for lunch. Luckily she asked the waitress about this before she ordered so she wasn't surprised by the bill when it arrived, like some other people have been. The menu really needs to be updated to say M-F though. Then as we were paying the bill, the friend who got the burrito had been charged an extra $2 for it. Overall a pretty mediocre meal, a bit too expensive, and WHO DOESN'T HAVE COFFEE? I would go back in a month or two if they are still around in the hopes that they will have figured out some of these issues. Oh, and the upstairs bathroom door knocks into the door to the kitchen, so I came VERY close to colliding with a waiter when I came out of it. Not a good design.",4,7,3,4
51,25304,401,7/6/10,"First visit to Odeon in many years was this past Sunday, a wickedly hot day in the middle of the Fourth of July weekend. We showed up around 6:15 PM, a full fifteen minutes earlier than our reservations. Contrary to expectations, Odeon had a good crowd, maybe two-thirds full. I used to work near Odeon a long time ago, more than 20 years ago, when dinosaurs still roamed the area. This was before it was even called Tribeca. It was just another gray, dismal part of the city. Then, along came The Odeon, the pioneer restaurant of Tribeca, and the crowds soon followed. Soon, more restaurants were opening, including those owned by Robert De Niro and pals, and the neighborhood began the slow transition into what it is today. So it was a real delight to find that The Odeon, despite the passage of so much time, hasn't lost a step. It is still a terrific bistro, serving up some wonderful food at reasonable prices. No wonder the crowds are still coming, even on a lazy and deserted three-day weekend. My wife had the heirloom tomato salad appetizer and I went with the frisee with lardons and poached egg. You'd have to toss a coin to decide which was better. I'm sitting here right now thinking about that salad, thinking that I'm going back in the next week or two just to have it again. I had the grilled fish (char) for my main, and my wife had the BLT, which came with some of the best potato salad either of us ever had. Both dishes were better than good, almost memorable. We swooned with delight over the hot fudge sundae, a large bowl of three scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream and accompanied by a small pitcher of hot fudge. So instead of the hot fudge congealing at the bottom of the bowl, we could pour a little over the ice cream as we slowly spooned it up. Our waiter wasn't the warmest guy in the world (no chitchat, no comments, no asides, just the service, thank you, ma'am). But he was professional, poured the wine when it needed pouring, never missed a beat, and did not distract from the meal. Our only regret was that we had not been back to this marvelous little gem in so long.",7,6,7,6

I'm a sucker for Duvel in that little goblet. But the real reason I love this place is that it is the number one bar on ninth to watch a soccer game on TV.

The atmosphere is fun and extremely energetic - be prepared for a crowd as this is always a popular spot.  Waitstaff is cordial and fun.  The chicken is amazing as you would expect but my favorite dish is the traditional Peruvian lomo saltado.  Their signature green sauce is the best I've had (if you want the recipe - I'll hook you up!)  Sangria pitchers are a must to compliment every meal.  The prices are fair as are the portion sizes.

The decor was really interesting and we went out back to their patio and checked out the coy fish ponds they have back there. Really cool, will really be great back there when it gets a little warmer out. The prices as every other review mentioned are really reasonable. I will definitely make this a new regular place to come to with friends. Check it out. Update: I had to drop a star off the original 5 I gave them. I had the oyster fry thats on their brunch menu that the cashier recommended, and it was not good at all. Very fishy tasting. The fish taco I ordered was almost tasteless.

There's something for every palate and every appetite on the menu. Most of the offerings have an Eastern European, stick-to-your-ribs sensibility, but under that umbrella there's a lot of room for variety. Service can be slow if it's busy, but most of the time the waitstaff couldn't possibly be nicer. While the menu looks very carnivore-oriented (carnivoriented?) at first glance, the best thing on the menu is actually meatless - the portabello mushroom sandwich with two kinds of cheese and chipotle mayo. It's big enough to share and full of awesome flavors.  If you'd like to send yourself to an early grave, go for the langos (fried dough covered in either cheese or sugary things), or - even better! - get a burger fried inside of a piece of langos. Seriously.  Other favorites - the arugula salad, the pierogis, and (dinner menu only) the squash gnocchi with pulled duck confit.

Wandering the Chelsea Market, I was trying to figure out what and where to eat.  I did not think a taco joint in this place could be such a standout.  Usually high traffic places have average food joints. I am a taco junkie.  And while I will eat an average taco when there aren't any excellent options for food, I do recognize a good or great taco when I have one. This is the most interesting taco place I have found yet.  Had the carne, chicken and pork (adobado).  Each one was excellent and well assembled.  When I started eating the adobado taco, lighting struck me, and I realized I found my new best taco joint. The carne was good meat quality, grilled well, and was very delicious.  Chicken was just as excellent.  It was juicy and flavorful - not the standard dry and cardboard like ""chicken"" that most places serve.  The adobado was astounding - SO much flavor.  This was a really beautiful taco and my favorite. The taco tortillas here are made fresh - you see them getting pressed and then grilled.  Flour tortillas are made with lard.  It was the best flour tortilla I've had and will be hard to top this in any other restaurant.  I also tried the corn tortilla and was very impressed with that as well.  I like both. Eating here is very casual and mostly standing at a counter.  Not really a date place, but perfect if you're in the area and need a satisfying meal.

I docked a star because it has communal tables which when the couple across from you is having a make out session is not the best way to enjoy your dinner. With that said this is the perfect place to go if you can fill the table with lots of friends. Make reservations -you need them. Also -CASH only!,7,9,9,9
85,7802,306,5/7/14,"Restaurants come and go often in Hell's Kitchen.  I had eyed the Ember Room for a long time, mostly because its interior looked great - but I never got to go.  Now it's gone and replaced by Obao, a restaurant specializing in Asian fare with a Vietnamese influence.  The space has been fixed up.  The front greets you with a bar and waiting area.  This leads to a wider seating area and then an elevated area in the back that offers a small amount of privacy (but is generally wide open).  The restaurant has gorgeous decorative lights and dark wood that makes it comfortable, attractive and modern looking all at the same time. The hostess greeted us with cheer and we were seated very quickly.  Our waiter was very attentive for the entire night, even after we began to eat.  He took our orders quickly and our food came out much faster than I had expected.  Here's what I tried: STICKY RICE WITH BBQ CHICKEN & SAUSAGE Exactly as described.  This dish is a glutenous rice cooked with a really smokey combination of chicken and sausage.  It's stretchy so you'll be scooping this out with a bit more effort than regular rice.  This was very flavorful and quite a treat. CLAY POT CATFISH Clay Pot isn't some fancy name for something else, it's a literal description of what this dish is served with.  Inside the pot are chunks of fish cooked perfectly to be tender and flakey.  There are definitely some amazing spice aromas including star anise that are given off by this dish and it's absolutely lovely.  This dish is served with a bowl of rice and could easily serve two people. I'm generally suspicious of any Asian fare in the Hell's Kitchen/Times Square area, but Obao definitely deserves kudos for a fantastic atmosphere and great food.",8,8,8,7
86,7672,629,5/14/12,"Call it weird, but I'm a huge fan of Butcher Bar, although I have yet to dine in at their BBQ mecca on 30th Avenue and fully savor everything they have to offer. I have gotten delivery (god bless you, Seamless iPhone app) from Butcher Bar a number of times and everything I've tried has been mouthwatering. Whether the pulled pork sandwich, the PBLT or brisket sandwich, all were spot on and drool worthy. Shame on me for not trying the burnt ends, but I promise it's next on the list for me! My go-to for Butcher Bar has been actually picking up the actual burger patties and grilling them on my balcony on my mid-sized Weber. I've tried the Bob's burger, their signature patties and the hot Italian sausage and I've gotten rave reviews for anyone I've made them for. Some folls have told me, they're the best burgers from a grill they ever had! With the burgers, 4 minutes on each side, a piece of Boston lettuce, red onion and a slice of organic cheddar and a small squirt of ketchup and trust me - people will go bonkers over them. The sausages are equally delish and have a nice bite to them. I really need to get my ass to their place and just do a nose dive into this meat heaven, but until then, I'll stock up on the world class burger patties.",8,7,8,8

The service was great and the food came out super quick. I thought that the Moroccon breakfast wasn't that good but it was presented great and was huge. Maybe I'm just not a fan of that dish in general. Great atmosphere. Would love to try the place again if it was less busy.,6,3,6,3

The menu isn't too big, and depending on your table size you may end up ordering the entire menu.  All the bottles of wine were $25, which was great, and we ordered a Malbec.  We really enjoyed all of the food - it was definitely unique and all very tasty.  There portions weren't very big, but we all got to try lots of different things which was nice.  Each dish came out with a full description on which ingredients were used and for what purpose.  I would only recommend coming here with people you're pretty close with, as the place is very small and you can end up crammed in a corner on a wobbly stool.  I'm still a bit confused on why the call themselves and Indian/Asian restaurant, but it was a great experience regardless!",7,6,6,6

We chose the bar so we could watch them cook. Everything from food to drink to service was perfectly executed.  We ordered the Khao Soi and coconut rice, the Crispy Curry Rice Salad, and Quail Adobo.  Flavors were a unique fushion of various south asian.  Everything was perfectly overcooked and spiced.   I would highly recommend the P&K cocktail, which in the waitress's words is ""their version of manhattan.""  A bit sweet for my tastes on its own but paired with some of the spicier dishes it was perfect for relieving the heat. Also would highly recommend sitting at the bar.

Ordered the scallops for entree which were really good. Friends had the lamb and steak which were very flavorful. MUST order the fries as a side, weird but it was definitely my to die for dish tonight. And the bone marrow? I just died a little again thinking about it. It was soooo good! Service was great, our waitress was very nice. We had late reservations which meant we were one of the last ones in and out of the restaurant. Didn't feel like they rushed us to get out at all.

Went here with a friend I hadn't seen in over a decade who coincidentally also happened to be in town over the weekend. Hostess told us no tables at all for the rest of the day and we had to try our luck at the bar. Ok. So trying your luck at the bar means darting your eyes every which way to notice someone making their way to leave, because, well, some people don't get the protocol that you were there first. Eventually my friend and I lucked out after 25 minutes of standing with two stools at the bar. We started off with a couple tall glasses of Brooklyn Ale and foie gras and I ordered the bar steak and frites. And as we waited, we watched as our friendly server/bartender was set up with some supposedly hot friend of this one French chick who's obviously a regular there. Nice going, dude. He wasn't even trying and here he gets some girl's number. Anyway, the food: Foie gras was excellent and so were my frites. But the steak was ok - I was expecting better, but then, for that price ($20-something) in a New York restaurant, I guess it was fairly decent. I really enjoyed the French-inspired atmosphere and could tell that the regulars here were treated like gold. It was an extremely comfortable place to be, even though it was insanely crowded. We could have sat at the bar for eons, which I'm sure many regulars do, but we had to scram. Not to mention some lady with 6 shopping bags eyeballing my seat. Or was she eyeballing my ""seat""?

For the main course, there were so much I wanted to try, Shrimp avocado tomato curry?? Mango Chicken cocout curry ??? boy that sounded too good to be true.

One of the best experiences I've had in a quite a while, with some impressive flavor combinations. Two of us shared: Asian Pear Salad: I'm lactose intolerant so they didn't put the goat cheese in the vinaigrette, which altered the dish. I still liked it a lot, with the asian pear having almost a candied sweetness and smooth texture which contrasted nicely with the bitter greens and walnuts. The speck (ham) seemed a bit superfluous but was tasty. Heirloom tomato salad: I thought it was fine--tomatoes were nice and crisp but not sweet. My friend liked a lot. Scallops: 3 nicely cooked scallops (good, but not the sweetest or pan seared best I've had) over a really wonderful memorable combo of corn, truffle oil and chives. I couldn't eat the accompanying carrot puree which had dairy in it. My friend liked. Oxtail ""terrine"": justifiably lauded in these reviews. Very flavorful pan fried beef that's been cooked with soy and allowed to stand and concentrate. Apple Miso sorbet. Tasty desert. Wish it came with something crunchy. Left sated but then again we're both light eaters. The staff was very conderate of my dietary restrictions and all were down to earth and pleasant. As I'm writing there's a review off to the right which describes the place as ""romantic."" Well, if there's one thing that could be easily improved it is the decor, which looks like an amateur attempt to dress up what might have been a Greek restaurant. Bathroom verges on kitch.

I found myself one saturday walking down bedford when I was invited to join up with a group of friends who were having brunch at Rabbithole.  We walked up around 1:00 pm and asked if they had garden seating available.  They said that for a party of 4/5 one on the way its looking like a couple of mins... thats it...we hung outside in the nice air and caught up and soon enough we had our table in under 7 mins!  Lovely We got very lucky as the only seating that could accommodate our big group was in my opinion the best seat in the house... or in the garden! Straight in the welcoming french doors from the street propped open by vintage wooden shoe mannequins... you can see the green garden down the hallway 'through the rabbithole!""   I gladly fell in. There at the other end of the rabbit hole in the back corner was the most coveted setting for a tea party..or blissful brunch.  A unique french country house aged and weathered table with a bench on one side and an eclectic assortment of chairs around the other sides. A few moments after being seated two large chilled carafes of water were set on our table.  Very much appreciated as it was a warm day.  Drink orders were taken and everyone was pleased with the coffee, orange juice, grapefruit juice and macchiatos ordered.   One of our group ordered the Big Bad Wolf Salad with avocados and it was a great big bowl and looked very filling as well as colorful and nutritious. Another friend had the steak and eggs and it was a lot of food! I shared the Eggs Benedict Norwegian ($13) with a friend as well as a side of the yummy fries ($4) with some sort of herbed mayo dipping sauce which was fantastic! We sat and had a leisurely brunch and never felt rushed to leave.  The staff was very friendly yet knew when to come and check on us and when to let us have our great conversations.  When 4 out of 5 people were there they gave us no hassle about the 5th person and did not hold up our orders. No attitude from anyone on this, the waitstaff were angels!

99,21805,468,2/3/13,"I'm wavering between 2 and 3 stars but I'll stick with the 3 because I actually enjoyed the salt and pepper pork chops and green onion pancakes (not what they're known for).  This a just OK restaurant and I know there are better options in this same vicinity.  I think this is a perfect example of the downfalls of being a restaurant that's heavily listed in Trip Advisor, Travel books (Lonely Planet) and food blogs.  They are very advertised and the quality of the food is just not there, especially with their most famous XLBs. We ordered their famous pork xiao long bao (shanghai soup dumplings) as well as the salt and pepper pork chops and green onion pancakes.  The XLBs are quite large but the skins were tough, the soup inside was thick and greasy and the meat was not as flavorful as I hoped.  We were sat with another couple at our table and without expressing our feelings, they let us know that they've had better dumplings in other places as well.  But, despite my disappointment, I do admit that I very much enjoyed their salt and pepper pork chops.  They were crunchy, hot and well flavored.  The green onion pancakes were also very well prepared and ate every single piece.  But, unfortunately people aren't looking for these items and would have to say you should look to other places for XLBs. Nearby I would recommend walking just a couple of blocks away to Shanghai Cafe (yelp.com/biz/shanghai-ca‚Ä¶ although there are many other terrific options in Flushing.",5,5,4,5

I would've done like I do at home but didnt want to embarrass the hubs any further. The Small Plates are ""exactly"" that, small, almost miniscule but delish! Blue Crab Waldorf (ode to my granny) is a great lite starter...again, I needed/wanted MUCH more! My entree was actually the Chicken & Waffle Sandwich. Good (needed more seasoning) but the other dishes were better. We had NO room for dessert but WILL be returning soon & eating dessert 1st! Drinks compliment this Bourbon-Whisky laced place.

In the end, a Chaise Lounge & Personal Trainer is needed with each reservation! EXCELLENT!  We'll definitely be returning, bringing family & friends & highly recommending! Tight quarters but we'll make it work. Chefs Jeff & Janine, are EXTREMELY friendly & engaging WITHOUT losing focus on the star-the dishes!

Luckily we made it in time. We ordered right away hoping the food would come asap. They make the pizzas after you order them. The pizzas are super fresh. We ordered 2 large pizzas both the same for a party of 4. We had sausage, extra basil, mushroom, and sun dried tomatoes. The pizza was steaming when we got it. The pizza was very clean and delicious. The crust is nice and thin. It was not overly cheesy, and the condiments are simple. I normally never eat pizza. However, I did eat more than usual here. That must mean something! We literally scarfed down our first slice. The pizza was amazing. Maybe the pizza was super good because we were so hungry? I don't know...

The service is fantastic, last time I ate here we were given a free glass of prosecco by the bartender and he shared a few laughs with us. I decided I was going to be a fatty and order a scramble for myself and a stack to share with my girlfriend.  The stack was awesome, 6 pancakes covered in butter and maple syrup, the pancakes were as light and fluffy as a cumulous cloud and I was a happy man.  Then my scramble came, I have to admit I was less than enthused with it.  I ordered the saussage and pepper scramble, it was dry, flavourless and to be honest not worth the $12 clams.

I recommend skipping their curries, I feel they're a miss by not having the depth and flavor you would expect. To me it's like they boiled hot water and mixed in some curry powder right before serving. However, their noodles are where it's at. For $8 you get a huge portion of noodles that can feed 2 (girls). I gobbled my entire plate up cause I was starving although my girlfriend brought the rest of hers home for lunch the next day. They also have Brooklyn Lager on draft, excellent!

I am not a picky person but I certainly do not think it falls within ""minimal"" sanitary norms to do all of the above while handling food and touching what goes inside a person's drinks with the same unwashed fingers that were inside your ears and scratching your head!

Save your hard earned $ and pass on this joint and try another soba/ramen eatery.  Their soup base was just okay. It reminds me of some instant noodle soup flavoring packets that comes in the bag (which isn't bad). We had the boiled pork appetizer and that's exactly what it tasted like...BOILED PORK! Besides it being well arranged on the plate topped with scallions, it lacked flavor and about 5 more hours of slow braising. Definitely pass on the boiled pork app! On to the soba. I had the chicken and chicken meatball soba (Kashiwa Soba I believe). You ONLY GET ONE chicken meatball in your bowl. The diced chicken tasted like it was diced and just boiled in your soup. Once again, the chicken lacked flavor. The soba was cooked to perfection. We also had the pork with chicken meatball soba. Needless to say, its the same. They also charge for hot tea! Most Japanese eateries don't charge for hot green tea with your meal. For 2 sobas and 1 app, the bill came out to $40 (includes tip and tax). If you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for some hot noodles. I say take a hike. A 3.5 block hike to be exact, to Big Wing Wong.

I think my disappointment came from not being able to order what I really wanted, which was the decadent-seeming Duck Burger. After some miscommunication between me and the waitress, and some weighing in on prices of items when they are not on the pre-fixe brunch menu...I heaved a heavy sigh and, feeling a bit of pressure to order on the spot coupled with only ""x"" amount of dollars in my pocket, ordered some banana pancakes with chocolate chips, along with a side of home fries. The pancakes were decent enough, though the bananas and chocolate chips were concentrated in the middle of each pancake and not evenly distributed. A pro is the fact that Sanford's uses real maple syrup. The con is that it comes in a tiny single-serving glass jar and charge a fee for a new one. I wanted to finish the last 1/4 of my already-drying up and quickly-cooling pancakes, but could not justify adding $3 to my bill just for a pour's worth of syrup, so I did not finish. The homefries were damn tasty at least...but cool in the middle. Hmmmmm. The boys got their respective meals, the steak skillet and French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. Both enjoyed. Both lucked out a bit more than I did, I feel. That being said, Adam's French toast looked really sad and pathetic; four diagonally cut pieces with no attempt at an aesthetically-pleasing plating. Hell, even a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar or a few slices of strawberries would have made a difference. I'm not opposed to coming back. I want that Duck Burger, dammit! I just need to bring more money next time and avoid the sweeter brunch items. The more savory options looked more appealing in general. Pro Tip: Get a drink and chill at the Starbucks down the street to kill the time of an hour+ brunch wait.",3,7,3,7

Definitely impressed with the food, I will definitely be back to kidnap that chef or to work my way through the menu, whichever is easier! Huge selection of beers and wines too with reasonable prices. Small place with 3-4 double tables, and bar seating. I wouldn't recommend groups larger than 3-4 to go or it could be a little cramped.

If you've been to one of them, you know the food is good. I've never been disappointed. However, my one complaint would be that the meats are all too salty. WAY too salty to eat on their own. I always order mac n cheese (bland) and/or cole slaw (sweet) to counterbalance how salty the meats are. AND drink tons of water. But it's still delicious. The chocolate icebox pie was yummy, too.

The owners of this place thought very carefully about their design and layout choices, and I think they chose well. The mood is super romantic and intimate with candles, perfect for a date or a small dinner with friends. Low hanging horizontal mirrors that add dimension and interest to the space, and midcentury jazz adds the right touch. The menu ranged from very standard French bistro fare (steak frite, escargot) but featured some other nontraditional items like salads and pasta. The desserts were pretty standard too (creme brulee and molten chocolate cake) but we were too full to try. The salad with duck was great, with the duck seasoned perfectly. Escargot came in a red sauce which was unusual but tasty. Onion soup was spot on and had a nice char on the cheese. Drinks were inexpensive but a little light in the pour. Overall, I liked my dinner a lot, and I will be coming back! √Ä la v√¥tre! Cheers!",7,6,7,6

That having been said, my first experience at the new BCD didn't knock the ball out of the park. The broth of our steaming hot stews was amazing, but the seafood in my soondubu tasted as if it had come straight out of a frozen bag of mixed shellfish (minus one legit piece of shrimp). My boyfriend's pork soondubu didn't have the tender fall-apart pieces of savory meat that I remembered from back in the day. The banchan left something to be desired, while the normally fleshy, deliciously crisp fried croaker served at the beginning of the meal was oily and over-cooked to the point of being basically fried skin. The music was characteristically odd (epic Titanic and Last of the Mohicans theme songs), but that didn't bother me. I'll definitely be back there for the soup, and am holding out hope that our over-fried fish was an aberration.",4,5,4,5

It was super cold outside, so I decided to try their salted caramel hot chocolate to warm up before I braved the outdoors. As I stood in line, I heard the guy behind the counter describe the hot chocolate as 'finishing' with a hint of salted caramel - or something like that. Usually, these kinds of descriptions make me roll my eyes. I like food as much as the next person, but let's not make it needlessly complicated. He was right, though. This hot chocolate DOES have an amazing taste of salted caramel after you drink it. It's pretty amazing. It's hard to describe, so just try it yourself. You won't be disappointed. At 4.00 a cup, the hot chocolate isn't  cheap. If you're looking for an exceptionally tasty way to warm up and if you're a fan of rich chocolate, it's well worth the money. Give it a try!",7,6,6,6
134,1904,175,7/17/14,"This is a 3, only because of the service. When you come to a place that is SO highly regarded in the foodie world AND on yelp, you have expectations. And such expectations are normal and not out of the ordinary. 1. You expect the hostess to walk you to your table and say here you go and wait until your seated to give you menus. Nope, here she walked past the table of 4 and towards the other table of 6 and expected us to know the table for 4 was ours. Then walked back and said could I help you?  2. You expect the waiter to ask you ""have you been here before? let me explain to you how our menu works and I suggest you order etc etc per person."" He did that after we made up our minds of what to order and he made a face like what we ordered wasn't enough. Not cool man. 3. You expect the waiter NOT to spill your wine multiple times as he pours glass after glass. Service was not good. The food spoke for itself and was exceptional - highlights were the spaghetti, roasted mushrooms were just all right, the olive oil cake and berry cobbler was delicious and melted in my mouth, and the roasted potatoes with cream on the side was amazing. The bottle of red we ordered was perfect as well. My friends and fianc√© enjoyed their fish, meat, and pasta options as well.

The Little Owl was the least fabulous. We were over the worst of our sticker shock by the time we got there, but I guess the bottom line is that the food was good but didn't match the prices. I was expecting a neighborhood place, which in my mind meant more modest in cost and that wasn't the case. I had the chicken dish, OK, not an exciting choice, and it was fine. My husband was warned that the special fish of the day had a lot of bones; he decided he wanted the other fish, which was served whole, not filleted and had lots and lots of bones. He's a expert filleter himself, so no problems,  but it's odd they didn't mention it.  We were going to a play and wanted to get out quick once we were through eating but had a hard time getting the check.

The bar is great for whiskey, pretty good for beer, and all employees were super friendly. Sadly, the food is just not on par with the rest. My sausage was completely raw and inedible. The pork ribs were terribly dry and difficult to eat. The brisket wasn't bad, but served nearly cold, and way too fatty for my taste. The chicken was probably the best thing I tried, but only the meat. The skin was so rubbery that it all came off in the first bite. The rub tasted pretty good, but I wasn't able to appreciate it since it was so difficult to chew. The sides were ok, potato salad tasted like it was soaked for days in vinegar, but the baked beans and pickles were good. I have read a lot of reviews, and it seems like an ""off night"" is pretty common, but, for the price- $56 of food for a light meal for 2, off nights really can't be this far off.

Most remarkably, the spaghetti with tomato and basil was excellent - amazing that such a simple dish can make such a significant impression. Even better was the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala sauce - the savory filling was balanced beautifully with the sweetness of the sauce. The agnolotti was also quite good, though definitely the third place finisher. What tipped the scale from 4 to 5 stars for me was the service - it was absolutely perfect. Our waiter struck the right balance between being professional yet relaxed. When asked for recommendations, he clearly knew what he was talking about - he provided very specific reasons why he suggested the dishes he did, without sounding rehearsed or spouting BS foodie-speak to sound impressive. He also ""read"" our table perfectly, knowing when was and wasn't a good time to interrupt, and anticipating our needs throughout the evening. Satisfying yet sophisticated food, excellent service, and a beautiful setting - Scarpetta deserves the praise it has received. And, important to note, absolutely NOT a Meatpacking-crowd.

Butchers steak is my fav hands down. Med or Med rare it's all good with the garlic butter. Well done comes out a bit burnt. Ax handle is good but not as flavorful as the butcher in my opinion. Lambchops were good but nothing unique about it. Eggplant app is small but the unique flavors together is worth trying. Monster prawns are huge and deserving of being called monster.

The mussels very tiny, and the broth ridiculously salty, found a few beards left on them and quite a bit of sand.  They need to clean their mussels better.  I don't know why everyone raves about the Lasagna dish, overly salty and reminded me of school lunch Lasagna I've had back then.  I'd only recommend their salmon entree that's about it.

(Upon his instance, the aforementioned taste buds also sampled both rolls, and, though I was not a huge fan of the mango-containing rolls, I quite liked the medley of perfectly-seasoned mushrooms in the other.) Great spot for casual lunches, perfect for vegans and those just trying to avoid meat for a meal. Also good for gluten-free folks!

It's meat, cheese, bun.  - Personally, I felt the meat could have used more seasoning and the patty could have been smaller (I don't eat a lot of meat so I may be biased, however my husband who does had the same comment) - Way too much bread - Too much cheese! It was a very salty intense cheese (which I usually love) but it overpowered the burger 2. Shoestring fries with fried garlic chips and fried rosemary were awesome but over salted. I did eat pretty much of all them. And would do so again if I went back. Cocktails were tasty but standard pricing for the area. Deviled eggs: awesome. You will wait half your lifetime for a table, but if you can snag a seat at the bar, go for it. The staff, while busy, was lovely- especially the bartender.

This is my preferred dining style, you saddle up, and pick what looks good depending on your level of hunger and budget. No menus, no waiting, it's perfect for kids. Super friendly Brazilian staff. The food is very authentic home cooking, which seems to represent several different geographical areas of Brazil.

152,27569,743,8/25/12,"I'll tell you this, they're just as tight-lipped about that secret sauce recipe at this location. I shouldn't seem surprised. I will let you know, I'm really close to getting that tangy, spicy, yellow-green sauce just right, it's just missing a little... hmm... something? I don't know why I thought that I'd get anywhere asking, oh so innocently and casually, ""So what's in this?"" Just cause we're at a different location, I thought guards would be down? I don't know. Well, skunked again... While I like the East Village location just fine, I like this BK locale even better. I'm a bit taken with the back garden, and I'm not even an overly, ""Ohh outdoor seating!"" kinda gal. Caracas Arepa Bar, Williamsburg style, has a lovely enclosed stone patio in the back where willowy tree branches float down through the trellises, there's a sweet little Virgin Mary grotto, and you're seated on brightly colored repurposed milk-crates or wooden benches. It's adorable and comfortable and overall an excellent place to feast on some arepas. And everything plantains. I love plantains. They make these ""yoyos,"" served as sides or starters, that are sweet plantains and white cheese, fried in a cinnamony batter and served with a dipping syrup on the side. Oooh so good if you're feeling breakfast-brunchy. Yuca croquetas and cheesy tequenos are great bites for sharing too. Of course you're coming for the arepas, and these arepas are the ones. The corn patties are light golden and crispy outside, fluffy and steamy inside. I love the ""DePabellon,"" which is stuffed with savory shredded beef, salty white cheese, black beans, and delicious sweet plantains. Ample amounts of that salsa concoction in squirt bottles on your table make it all tastily complete. I would have originally repped DePabellon as my favorite, but the true truth of the matter is that the one I order most, her name is, ""La Mulata."" She's a vegetarian. This arepa really does the trick for the ole gal- it's full of grilled cheese, red peppers, hot jalapenos, black beans, and sweet plantains. I don't need to mention that table sauce again, but you know that goes right in there too. If you can't seem to decide which arepa strikes your fancy and you're with a pal, Caracas Arepas Bar also offers a plate for two to share which features mini arepas versions each: two ""DePabellon,"" two ""La Mulata,"" and two ""Reina Pepiada"" (Mild yet tasty cold chicken and avocado salad). An arepas feast for two. So, as I was sniffing around for the elusive salsa ingredients, almost as if to distract me away from pestering for clues, one of our friendly servers asked us if we really liked hot and spicy food. YES, in fact, yes we do! He vanished for a moment and then quickly reappeared with a squirt bottle of creamy orange sauce that was truly hot and flavorful. I loved it. Great stuff. Written on its masking tape label was the word, ""Chingona."" Was that the name? Cause if it's, ""Chingona,"" if so, then it's an accurate one... cause that sauce was one badass business. Annnd now I'm fixated on another of their sauces. You ain't seen the last of me.",8,6,8,6
153,140548,766,11/15/12,"To be fair, I can understand where the negative customer-service reviews are coming from. The scene upon entering can be daunting for a first-time diner, as there's almost always a line and no host(ess) to speak of. There is, instead a list held by one of the waiters, but if you get on it, you'll find that the wait time is generally no longer than half an hour. If you're not dying if hunger, waiting it out at a local bar is well worth it. When seated, you'll find the waitstaff straight-forward, friendly, and helpful, albeit, VERY busy. I've never been to this restaurant and NOT seen it full (even immediately following Hurricane Sandy), and it's important to note that there's a reason for that. This place is very much a local favorite, and there are frequent regulars that get their due attention. After our third visit, one of the waiters who commonly most holds the coveted list recognized my boyfriend as well, and it's nice to know that that many visits warrants a lasting (positive!) impression as well. As for the post important part, the food: excellent all around. I firmly believe the negative reviews about the food show an overall lack of knowledge about authentic Italian cuisine on the part of the reviewers. If you came looking for a fried chicken cutlet covered in cheese, you definitely chose the wrong place. I've had the risotto, the pasta, and the steak (in addition to a number of appetizers, including the sardines) and I've been very happy with everything I've tried. The wine selection in consistent and the house wines are completely acceptable (though, as with most places, the better vintage is sold only by the bottle). To date, my favorite dish is any of the seafood specials, as they handle shellfish preparation excellently here (no drowned oysters and the like). All dishes are prepared to bring out the best of the main ingredients and not over-power them; you can taste your steak, appreciate the home-made texture of your pasta, and little touches like adding chili peppers to the olive oil make the experience unique and memorable. Dessert is similarly delicious. I for one will be very sad to see the pumpkin panna cotta (which I suspect to be a seasonal offering) go. In short, be patient, bring cash, and you will not be disappointed.",7,4,7,4
154,93518,247,4/24/14,"I. Mother. F'n LOVE THIS PLACE! My favorite Japanese noodle house in the city. I have no idea what they put in it to make it so addicting. I've eaten at quite a few other noodle spots in the city but nothing is as good as Ippudo. Lunch is the time to go. Most of the dinner items are available but cheaper and some come as specials (a few items like rice and add-ons to make it a more complete meal). The dinner is more expensive but just as good with a slightly different take on the food and an expanded menu. Great sak√© selection. I cannot rave enough about this place and I have several friends and family who now frequent this place. They've also expanded to the West Side & I have yet to try it but my cousin said it's just as good. Also, try to save room for their dessert; Mascarpone cheese & ice cream. Drooling just thinking about it. And I don't even EAT desserts . . . Service is quick and efficient. Cons: The wait can be bad, especially if your 1-4 people. But for me and everyone I've brought here, the wait has lived up to the hype. Best bet is to put your name in and check the time. If it's a while, there's a bar around the corner on 10th or Village Pourhouse two blocks away on 3rd & 11th. Catch a beer there to kill some time and then check your table. They're very good at estimating their time, so be vigilant. Larger groups tend to have a shorter wait time. Also, if your creeping towards 3 pm and are trying to get a table, you most likely won't be able to get in. They close their kitchen at 3:30 (unless your already sitting) and re-open at 5pm, so make sure you get there early. Also, they ABSOLUTELY will not allow you to bring home any leftovers. It sucks, but true. I've seen arguments erupt in the dining room. So be forewarned. So make sure you GOOOOOO! And enjoy!",9,8,8,8

Here's the lowdown on the food: - chips and guacasalsa: mix of crispy corn, plantain and taro chips served with a great guac and salsa fresca. get this. - plantain stuffed with pork: a big juicy sweet plantain sliced down the middle, brimming with shredded pork. delicious. get this. - special of plantain stuffed with seafood: this was savory plantain formed into a sort of ramekin, with ceviche-like filling. good but not the best on the table. - mussels: served in the most flavorful red sauce. you have to get this. if you don't like mussels, consider just ordering it for the sauce!

For apps I had crab cakes and shrimp cocktail...I thought the crab cakes were not bad the had good flavor of crab amd I could actually taste crab meat and the out side had a nice crunch...the sauce that was served on top complemented it well too.  The shrimp cocktail had nice size shrimp..other than that it was just shrimp cocktail. For dinner I had the gumbo...I felt it lacked flavor...it was spicy as hell but that was the only taste it had...also the sauce was soupy...the sauce should have been rich and creamy...it just wasn't good...I couldn't even finish it. The place is nice, its kool, the staff was great...but the food IMO just wasn't good.",3,6,3,6
157,47434,521,6/29/09,"Like so many places in our fair city, Di Fara's is an establishment every New Yorker should check out at least once in their time here.  And then probably never go back ever again. My plan was to check out the famed pizzeria in the middle of the week, after lunch but before dinner in order to minimize wait time.  It worked perfectly!  My guy and I strolled in, ordered our pizza right away and had it ready and piping hot within 15 minutes.  No fuss, no muss. The pie itself is a feast for the eyes-- I could hardly contain my glee as I watched Dom snip the fresh basil onto our pie-- I gushed and oohed like a school girl with a pop star crush.  ""It's a work of art!!"" I exclaimed to Dom as he smiled.  Meanwhile he's probably thinking this girl needs to get some pizza in her mouth so she'll SHUT UP. The pizza has a beautiful char and is covered with just the right amount of mozarella and grated parmesan.  The fresh basil is incredibly fragrant and is the perfect complement to the sweet and tangy tomato sauce.  The olive oil drizzled on top did have a tendency to drip and get all over my hands, making for a somewhat messy eating experience, so if anything I would just be wary of that. Because we're overly ambitious eaters, the two of us ordered a whole pie to share (half cheese, half sausage and pepperoni) and had 3 slices left over (which made for a delicious late night meal).  Di Fara's definitely dishes out a great pie and watching Dom work on his craft is really a NY experience not to be missed.  With that said, I'd probably be willing to wait 30 minutes max for his pizza but anything more I'd suggest you come back when you can enjoy your pie without the long lines and cranky attitudes.",6,6,6,7

We ended up getting some of the best customer service I've ever received thanks to Danny or Denny (I believe) and the other staff that served us that night.  He just went above and beyond to make sure we had the best night and I truly thank him for that. We had shrimp appetizers, some kind of fried fish, breaded mussels or clams (I just know they were delicious, ok!) salad, steak, fish, pizza, fries, and the biggest dessert I've ever seen!!!  I literally wanted to throw up (Hunger Games style, as a member of my group put it) so that I could keep eating more, MORE, MORE! lol....pizza was great, but I truly enjoyed the rest of my meal as well...to the point that I was wondering how they managed to serve me the best broccoli I've ever had in my life (lol).  I will definitely come back if I am ever in NYC again!!",9,9,9,9

When I think of this place hospitality is the first word that comes to mind. Momo Sushi Shack sets the example of how other restaurants should be ran. That all being said I felt the food was forgetful, and the service was overcompensated for the lackluster food.

The bf had the Colombian breakfast and I had the Latin breakfast with a side of coconut french toast. The portions were huge and left us completely satisfied. I also pounded down a couple DELICIOUS pomegranate mojitos [only $5 at brunch] with fresh muddled limes, mint and pomegranate seeds. And although the drinks looked petite, they packed a punch that caught up with me quickly. During dinner hours they bring complimentary plantain chips with homemade salsa. Which is kind of sweet and spicy almost reminiscent of a Latin duck sauce. Strange, but quite tasty. We've been back for dinner a few times since. Did i mention $5 drinks ALL NIGHT mon-wed? The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars, is they seem to be a bit understaffed at times. A few times we've waited up to 10 minutes to be greeted, have drinks delivered, etc. So, maybe not the best place to grab a quick bite..but certainly the best place to grab everything else.",6,8,6,8

Also, the service was HORRIBLE. Our server seated us and didn't take our order until TWENTY minutes later. He forgot to put in the order for my request for chorizo so i had to wait another 15 minutes, and he didn't even apologize. Never re-filled our water and came around ONCE to ask if everything was ok.

We ordered the cha momo--sooooo good. They weren't anything new and honestly I think they were pork and chive dumplings like you could get in Chinatown, but they were cooked really well. Although the skin was pan fried, it wasn't too heavy or thick, and it was so juicy that when you bit into it, there was a little overflow of yummy meaty juices. I got the sha dofu, which was a stir fry of various vegetables, tofu, and beef in a sauce that tasted vaguely tomatoey. I liked it, as it had the same ingredients as a lot of Asian cooking but the sauce was different. I'll definitely try them again.",7,9,7,9

One of the first things that attracted me to Saxon + Parole was the fact that they offer a menu of non-alcoholic cocktails. For someone who's not drinking at the moment I was so happy to have the choice of something other than water. Hallelujah! We both ordered the cucumber thyme drink which was as refreshing as it sounds. For an appetizer we split the scallops. The scallops were very tasty and I loved the pistachios and raisins sprinkled on top. I did think $15 for two scallops was a bit steep, though. I ordered the sea bass for my entree while my friend got the hangar steak and a side of crispy brussels sprouts. The fish was cooked perfectly and while I enjoyed the accompanying spaetzle, ramps and mushrooms, I wish there had been something crunchy on the plate. My friend loved her steak, and we both devoured the crispy brussels sprouts. I think those were actually my favorite part of the meal.

Eggrolls are nowhere near as good as other Filipino households and this one is not a fusion dish at all (so really no excuses here). We also had the Longanisa which is just ok as well. My friend had the Ube waffles with Fried Chicken and he loved it! Drinks were nice and refreshing. Lastly, the cheesecake was alright and the coconut flan was seriously inedible we thought they made a mistake like forgetting the sugar?!? So yea, 3 stars, glad they redeemed themselves but never going back. Oh plus- you smell after you eat here because they have poor air vents and the back is an open kitchen.

We were waited on by an incredibly enthusiastic man with a pony tail who was a self-proclaimed musician. I asked him for his recommendations on mead and he whole-heartedly recommended Carroll's mead which, according to him, has voice soothing properties. We weren't that hungry so we went ahead and just ordered the wings. Before bringing out our food, they brought us a bowl of popcorn. All I have to say is wow. That is some bomb-ass popcorn. The secret, according to them, is beer yeast. Whatever, it might as well have been crack-cocaine. We inhaled the bowl in minutes and was too embarrassed to ask for seconds. Our drinks were very good. I forgot what my gf had but the Carroll's mead was as good as the pony-tailed man had said. It was sweet, for sure, but had a flavor that mellowed out in the end. The wings were huge, crispy, and incredibly juicy. The flavors were very strong, and may have contained a bit of coffee with teriyaki. The people that came here seemed pretty dressed to the nine. Can't say the same for me. Moody ambience makes it a great place for a date. Prices are reflective.",8,9,8,9

The service was okay, certainly nothing to write home about. We were a group of 4 and they put us at a table of 6 and then sat two people in the other seats. Nothing inherently wrong but the setup required us to talk to our waitress and order with these people right between us, was kind of awkward. Eventually other tables opened the couple asked to move to another seat. Food was okay. The cheese plate was good and so was the fish and chips.

I can't even describe the honey butter. It is so decadent. My friend Ian had the chicken and waffles and is already desperately trying to recreate the crunchy batter in his own kitchen. I also fell in love with the sweeter side of the menu with Pies and Thighs' donuts. When I was there they had a gigantic pumpkin-spiced donut that was crunchy and caramelized on the outside and warm and spicy on the inside. It cost like $1.50. Where I'm from this thing would be at least $4.00. I love America. The staff were lovely when we were there and got us seated quickly despite the huge line ups.

We got there at 10:30 AM today thinking that we were beating the brunch rush...No such luck - the wait was over 2 hours. Luckily the Lower East Side is chock full of dining options to while away your time / hunger, and the restaurant will text you when your table is about to be ready. Truthfully, it was close to 3 hours before we were seated. We split orders of the Blueberry Pancakes, Spanish Scramble, and some Cazuela Hash special. Sugar-cured bacon and biscuits with jam on the side. The pancakes are as marvelous as everyone says - wonderfully fluffy, generous with the blueberry sauce, and the maple butter on the side is amazing. Best pancakes ever, for sure. I think the heavyweight of the meal was actually the sugar-cured bacon.  My dining companion actually asked our waitress if they sold any raw bacon that he could buy and make at home.... (after being rebuffed, our table schemed ways that we could concoct a DIY recipe for sugar-cured bacon... sugar brine? syrup marinade? who knows.) The other dishes are pretty mediocre, pretty much something you could get at any other brunch establishment. All in all, it is a bit befuddling why the wait for this place is so epic... aside from the pancakes, the other entrees are nothing to write home about. One thing I severely disliked is that the restaurant is not keen on lingerers... Considering that I just waited 3 hours for this breakfast, I feel I should be entitled to linger over my cup of coffee. But no siree, after being prompted several times by our waitress if we were ordering anything else, we took the heavy-handed hint and skedaddled.

It tastes so much better with loads of that white sauce (don't know what it's made of and don't care) and hot sauce, if you like it spicy. For the price you pay, this can't be beat.

I'm pretty sure whatever dish you order will end up being delicious, especially since all the dishes we ordered were fantastical:    3.a. Scallop dish with plums was absolutely amazing. I don't even know what to say. Strong, bold flavors, and big charred juicy scallops.    3.b. The foie gras/terrine dish was heavenly. Velvety smooth with a delicious crunch from the toast. And I've never had pickled tomatoes before. Very interesting concept.   3.c.  Again, the Brunster was right in saying that the fried chicken here was the best ever. It was the best ever. A combo of white & dark meat, a creamy smooth buttermilk sauce, and a super fresh corn & chantrelle relish type thing. The corn tasted smokey too. I love corn. Anyway, great place for an extremely satisfying and unique meal. Or for after work drinks and food. It's all kind of family style and the waitstaff is super nice and laid back.

I actually read all the reviews on yelp and picked this place for dinner for 4. It was a cold ""polar vortex"" of a night. They sat us right in the middle of the restaurant. Everytime the door opened a giant cold gust of wind smacked us all in the face. It was so uncomfortable. We couldnt' move because the restaurant was so full. Also, very very noisy. The gluten free thing drew me in but was an epic failure. When the waiters came around and asked us if we had any ""food allergies"" they were not even clear as to what they were asking. Then they offered us gluten free or regular bread. We asked what  the gluten free bread was made out of and the waitress actually had no idea so she brought us a plastic wrapper package from the back with the ingredients on it. It was a huge turn off and majorly poor judgement. I actually felt embarrassed that she did that- we all did. Then the waiter came back and asked us all if we'd like to see Dessert menus. We were like ""we haven't even gotten our food"". After waiting for 45 minutes... The food was really sup-par. I ordered a lobster and shrimp in cream sauce risotto. It was just ok. Immediately after I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded. I had to put my head down on the table. Then I lost all feeling in my legs and arms and my pulse was racing. This lasted for 5 minutes. My family was concerned and might have called 911 if I didn't snap out of it. After all of that, I think there was something bad in my food.

After being seated to a small table near the bathroom, we immediately asked to sit at the bar. The size of that table was ridiculous!! Is this a table for menus or condiments...def not for 2 people to sit and eat their entrees. When we sat at the bar, the bartender/waiter?? was very weird. We asked him one  question and it was what flavor was that bottle of drink. He then said hold on a second, turns around and stock his drinks (he stocked 3 boxes). Like seriously??? it was so late already, is the drinks more important or the customer in front of you? After waited 3 minutes for him to finish stocking. He then asked us what? and the answer was grapefruit. How hard is it to tell us ""grapefruit"" 3 mins ago. He obviously don't care about his tips.

Yea, there is an ATM machine right next to the entrance. I hope they didn't do this on purpose so they can charge you for using their ATM machine too.

Serious props to Elton. Anyway, we went as per his request for his birthday, and it was an amazing meal. As an enthusiast of Cuban Pete's in Montclair, NJ and all things Buena Vista Social Club / Ruben Gonzalez, personally I was thrilled to hear we were headed here. Perfect for a date or a large group (I think we were about ten), every aspect of our meal here was fantastic. The service was a little slow; but I think that just tends to be the case when you're such a large table. First off, when you walk in, it's like stepping out of Brooklyn and into Havana. (Okay, with a few of North Side's hipster eccentricities still here and there.) It's super loud in there and definitely boasts more of a party atmosphere, but sometimes I think that's almost better for a date because you have to talk that much closer. Perhaps it was just the particular live music that they had that night; very festive. It's always the best when you can watch and listen to an actual musician while you're dining. As great as the atmosphere was, the food and drink was even better. This is absolutely high-quality, gourmet cuisine. It's a given that the worse my photos are; the better the food must be, because it's that much less time I had to get the shot before a thousand hands start tearing the food to shreds, myself included. They've got tons of beer and wine; but their seasonal and standard cocktails are certainly the way to go, and pack quite a punch, making them very worth their price. The Smokey Menendez and the Dill Paloma are my favorite; el beit they contain whiskey and tequila, respectively, and Cubana Social is technically more of a rum place, given that it's a Cuban restaurant. Alas, the food. The one item I'm most excited to write about is the one thing I didn't quite manage to get a picture of. However, I thought everything was so absolutely delicious that I even included the menu below for your perusal. The great thing about going as such a large group is that you can order up a hundred and one different things; and that's exactly what we did. The duck confit empanadas (all of the empanadas really), are incredible. Everything we ordered tasted so fresh and really high quality in terms of ingredients; and that really does make all the difference. The best thing you can order, however, is the tostone tacos, which is a fish of the day (in our case, it was tuna in ceviche form), a slightly spicy cilantro aioli, and a heirloom tomato pico de gallo. Another catch of the day option is the ceviche, which they totally nailed. We must have ordered like 4 of them. The crispy avocado, while good everywhere and hard to mess up, was also really delicious. Their's was served with a guava habanero sauce, very similar to the way that it's served up at Ravi de Rossi's Cienfuegos. As for the mains; the ropa vieja was very well done; but I think myself and our friend Nick had the best entrees; we both ordered a very traditional lechon asado with lots of garlic and lime, rice and beans. It's hard to beat that kind of simple yet amazing hearty home-style meal. (PS - they also specialize in Cuban coffee.)",8,5,8,4

We got there at 6:15 and the hostess said the next seating is at 7:45pm. Wow. Ok I guess it's my fault for being a slow poke with reserving a spot. We end up getting seated at 8pm. The place has a nice, relaxing atmosphere.. Maybe a little too relaxing as people were taking just about forever eating and chatting (I prefer the hustle and bustle of totto because I like my soup hot over lukewarm but hey, we all have preferences). Oh yeah expect to have friends of the staff to be seated before everyone else too. There were at least two instances of those but I guess it's understandable if I was a worker there too? Appetizers: We ordered the u&i bowl and I have to admit it was really tasty. The uni with the spicy tuna, wasabi, rice and roe just blended so well when eaten together. So yea, at least they've got that going for them. Ramen: My boyfriend ordered the mu ramen (at a whopping $18) and I got the tonkatsu 2.0. The tonkatsu was a LOT better. The tonkatsu broth was good, but not great, and just more flavorful than the mu. The mu ramen just tasted kind of bland. I also don't like the thin ramen they use but again, it's preference, so I won't rate them on that. This meal, altogether, cost about $60. I can't tell you how pissed I was that at this price you get 1) an extremely slow turnover rate 2) forever wait times (at least ippudo or totto are worth it AND you get the loudest and friendliest greeting at the door and when you leave??) and 3) insanely overpriced ramen. I want to say I wanna come back to try the miso ramen but jeezus if they're going to charge $18 for a mediocre ramen, I'll drive to the city for something better.

All of the entrees were delicious but the fried pork leg, which gets carved table-side, had us all still talking and texting the next day. (I woke up to a text: OH MY GOD PORK LEG.) A tip: take the fried skin that comes off this dish and fill it with garlic rice and any one of the myriad delicious condiments you're offered. You will be glad.

Walked in and said I was there. 2 minutes later after waiting in the overly packed front entrance (I mean---honestly they had about 25 people crammed into a 2x2 space!)

A- two weeks ago I ordered 2 dishes of curry with chicken katzu (it comes with a personal salad) and an appetizer, when the delivery arrived (after 30 min) I tipped the guy, and put the food on the table preparing to eat, few minutes later when I opened the bag I discovered that 1 curry is missing . I called them to let them know, and they sent the guy back (20min) hey arrived and brought the missing dish, but wait he forgot to bring the salad! So he went back and 15 min was back again. Me and my boyfriend needed to eat in phases.  My only composition was ""sorry..sorry"" anyway I let it slide. B- few days ago I order (on seamless) from them again, 1 curry with chicken katzu and chicken nuggets, 30 min later delivery shows up and brings me my stuff, stupidity I did  the same mistake and didn't check the bag before putting it on the table. Few minutes after when we seat to eat I discover that we missing the curry suace?!?! (It comes separate packaging). I'm trying to call them (for 20 min) but the phone is disconnected.

As most of the other reviews have stated, Calle Ocho includes a free do-it-yourself sangria bar during brunch.  There were 6-8 different flavors to choose from, and each of them was fantastic.  What I love about this place is that there is not an additional charge for the unlimited sangria - it is included with the price of your entree (around $15 average).   My recommendation would be to either get a reservation because you'll need one, or get there right around 11:30am when they open so that you can seat yourself in one of the lounge areas that has big couches and little tables.  We came for a friend's birthday brunch as a group of 12, but couldn't get a reservation, so we arrived right at 11:30 and had our pick of the huge lounge area.

The rest of the food was bland, riddled with thick layers of fat or small portions for the price.  As for the mythic pork buns?  The reason they melt in your mouth is that 95% of it is fat!

It's a very comfortable, cozy space -- not pretentious at all. Second, I like the service. Just the right amount! Proficient, and unobtrusive. I never feel like I get interrupted by a server, but they are usually within reach if we need something. Third, the food is thoughtful, locally sourced, clean and offers something for everyone. I know I can come here with family or friends and be taken care of! Fourth, value for money. All of these things mean that while I don't go out to eat as much as I used to, when I do go out, I want a great meal,and something I can't cook at home. I never, ever leave here regretting having spent the money -- I wish I could say that about more places these days!!",9,3,8,3

Everything I've had here over multiple visits has been amazing.  Soba, lunch sets, sushi/sashimi.  It's all so good. Soba-ya is a pretty small space given it's popularity though.  So if you're coming with a big group (larger than 6) come early.  You'll notice people starting to stand outside and line up before the place opens.  So get in line and prepare yourself for a great meal.",9,5,9,5

245,71291,212,10/7/11,"I went to Saxon + Parole the other night with a girlfriend and had a fabulous time. We went early and started with a yummy cocktail at the bar. I don't remember what the drink was called, but it was sweet and boozy at same time. The scene at the bar was so pleasant; a nice breeze, friendly bartender, and neighbors that we really liked (we decided to forgo a table and at at the bar instead because of them). Everything we ordered sounded super-simple, but the flavors were complex. The mini seafood tower was a real surprise. I'm used to this being straight-forward -- raw oysters with some clams and shrimp. I think the mussels were smoked? It was a flavor explosion. The mushroom pot is amazing! It's so light and tastes like the essence of mushroom. I probably would have been happy with just the starters and a cocktail, but we also ordered the short rib. I always order short ribs when they are offered. These were perfect (actually one very large rib), juicy, falling off the bone with a slightly crispy, tasty coating. YUM and YUM. The interior of the restaurant is also very cool, but everyone was focusing on the food. We were so into our meal that a couple sitting near to us at the bar copied our order dish for dish.",9,8,9,8

247,5040,548,10/16/11,"This is a great place to eat if you can't be bothered with waiting in the lines for the other Korean places or just on a time crunch. After studying for over 6 hours on Saturday and then walking through Occupy Time Square, I was famished by 8pm. I needed fuel and I needed it fast. I have wanted to try Woorijip for a long time, but the occasion never presented itself...until Saturday night. At 8pm, this place was bustling with people. I grabbed a styrofoam tray and started down the buffet line. It is $6.99/pound and they have some good choices for vegetarians. I managed to get some octopus, edamame, sushi rolls, grilled mackerel, veggie pancake, and a tofu cake. Everything was fresh and well made. No complaints! The octopus was really really good. I think I should've just gotten a whole tray of that. They also have great ready-to-eat boxes. If you like beef over rice, they have plenty of lunch boxes. They also have a spicy tofu soup that I was eyeing for a long time. They also have all sorts of kimchi, bimbimpap options, banchan, rolls, slices of pumpkin, corn and some vegan options. My head was swimming after being in this place, but in a good way. So many options and for pretty cheap. I sat down to have my food and there was a party of 8 next to me doing soju shots. Yes, they also have alcohol here. So you had people eating their dinners, people doing shots, people reading and eating. It was a tru cafeteria scene with alcohol involved. It was so lively. I enjoyed my experience here and I recommend it if you are looking for a place to eat and don't want to wait for your food.",7,2,7,2

After reading the numerous reviews I knew I had to try this place and as luck would have it, we stayed at The Blakely just around the corner. I convinced the BF that we just had to try it, even though the line spanned half a city block. I decided on the lamb sandwich and he got the chicken sandwich. We hurried back to the hotel so we could dive in to the meaty goodness. It was everything I hoped for. A soft fluffy pita stuffed to the brim with gyro-like lamb, topped with a bit of lettuce for crunch and doused with white sauce. Beware the hot sauce, it's crazy hot! A delicious meal for $4! Amazing! Now if I can only convince them to open up in SF...",7,4,7,4

Very subtle flavors and great taste.  You can't get these flavors anywhere else.  Agnolotti - unbelievable - youtube how they make it.  Polenta and mushrooms - not exactly low cal but worth every calorie.  I have tasted spagehetti but their's is unique and top three i have ever tasted.  It is worth ordering without a doubt which sounds crazy!   I can't get enough of this place.,8,8,8,8

Fingerling Potato Saltimbocca Carpaccio Of Beef Tuna Tartare Crispy Brussels Sprouts  (these are simply divine) Pulled Pork Empanadas Braised Short Rib of Beef The desserts are awesome too - they change a lot though so I didn't bother putting up the ones I had because they aren't there anymore.

Sure, they have a menu with many great sounding things on it, but stick with the falafel.  It's the what made Mamoun famous and why they're still in business after all these years.",8,2,8,2

254,10202,895,12/29/11,"When one works in midtown, they are destined to visit either Tina's or Sophie's at least once for delivery.  Both are phenomenal, but I have a personal affinity towards Tina's.  I stumbled into Tina's the last day of my first internship, which was located right on 5th avenue and the 50s.  I was looking for a place to grab lunch and there was Tina's.  I ended up purchasing a combo plate, consisting of Pernil, rice and beans mix, and I choose the fried sweet plantains as my last side.  The succulent Pernil (roasted pork)still makes my mouth water, and the rice and beans mixture slaughters that of Sophies.  I love how they get all mixed up and mushy and really infuse into one oherent side. The fried sweet plantain is awesome, although I would prefer it to be a bit crispier.  Deliveryt ialweays speedy, nd the portions are more than generous.  My only other real gripe is that with their green sauce.  While it can be delicious, it is terribly inconsistent with respect to the spice level.  Sometimes, a drop of it is enough to set your mouth ablaze, while other times you literally need to dump in both containers in order to get any heat whatsoever.  More foten than not, you end up underestimating the spice level of the salsa, or going off of the one you got last time, and your mouth is seared to the point to where it can hardly taste the rest of your meal.",7,8,7,8
255,10295,746,8/28/11,"Please note: Dining here was purely because of hurricane Irene.  Nothing else was opened.... So long story short, even though I live in New York, I ended up at a hotel this weekend.  With hurricane Irene on its way and all transportation shut down, it was pretty much a given that we would be eating at this hotel restaurant.   I typically do not enjoy dining within a hotel, I like to explore and I find that the menus tend to be vastly overpriced.  This hotel was no different.  Nothing too special or crazy on the menu.  Wine was overpriced but tasty.   First night we ordered: Tuna tartare: so good, one of my favorite foods, and it did not disappoint. Salmon: Wasn't cooked the way we had requested but it wasnt dry at least and I found it good.  Portions were small though Scallop: Are you serious? one scallop for $14? I liked the way it was prepared and the corn it came along with. Mediterranean Platter:  Ridiculous amount of pita bread, served with flavorless humus (hardly enough for all those freaking pieces of pita), Olive puree stuff, and olives.  Easily could have done without it and really didn't like it actually.   Second night we ordered: ricotta and mozzarella fritters: who doesn't love fried cheese? like upscale mozzarella sticks Field green Salad: Better than I expected, I liked the dressing.   Pasta Special of tomatoes, basil pasta in a tomato sauce: Nothing special but I liked it.   Service wasn't the best but it was during the hurricane so I assume they were under staffed.  Overall we were pretty lucky that this was a decent place since we had no other option.",5,6,5,6

It's like a mixture of ranch, mayo, plain yogurt, spices, I don't know what, but it keeps you coming back for more.  And I've also read that the spicy sauce is the sauce of death, so please don't drown your food in that sauce.  But the white sauce, by all means, do it! But if you take away the white sauce, there's just a lot of yellow rice, lettuce, and your meat of choice.  I actually find the other part of the meal very medicore.  Sometimes the rice and/or the chicken is dry, and the chicken really isn't that flavorful.  And of course the lettuce is iceberg.  I actually would just want to raid the white sauce from the cart here and put it on my own chicken and rice. So to average out: white sauce is amazing but the food itself is very so-so.",5,4,5,4

There's exposed brick wall and little bird cages here and there. down in the basement, you'll also find a nice garden. Can't believe it's in the basement! Feel like a rooftop bar already.

About 15 minutes in, they let us know that they were on their last batch of fries and therefore might not get a chance to taste these yummy fries and amazing sauces. Luckily, the friendly people in front of us cut down on their order. Ended up choosing just two sauces, the mango mayo and parmesan peppercorn mayo though I wanted to try just about everything else on their menu. Both were very unique and great tasting. The mango wasn't too sweet and the parmesan wasn't too cheesy tasting. Again, a perfect mixture of salt, sweet and everything else in between. Many people stopped by inquiring about the long wait for ""just fries."" I've got to say these are not just any fries. These were hot, thick and not too oily. It had a great texture, a tad crunchy on the outside and soft but not overcooked in the inside.

Let's just say we were met at the door by a hostess who wasn't particularly friendly.  We felt like we were bothering her and they certainly weren't happy to have our business. It went down hill from there. We had a 20 something blond waitress from Alabama that had to be the worst server I have EVER encountered.  First she got our drink order wrong, bringing my husband the incorrect beer.  She blankly looked at him like ""oh well, I guess you can just drink that kind then.""  He had to actually ask her to go get the correct kind and take the wrong one back.  She forgot my mixed drink and finally brought it about 20 minutes later. Appetizers were good and brought without any problems.  Then dinner.  We waited, and waited and waited.  This was a 5:30ish meal on a Saturday.  The place was not very crowded at all so puzzling with the wait.  Finally our burgers were brought out.  Well everyone's meals except mine.  Not a word about mine being out soon.  I waited and waited and waited.  She finally came back.  Believe it or not I had to ask where my meal was.  Blank look in response.  She then said it would be right out.  Well about 20 more minutes and my burger was finally served.  The order was even incorrect.  When I asked for what I ordered I received a blank look and was told it would be right out.  Another 10 minutes and finally my correct dinner was brought to the table.  The rest of the table was completely done with their meals by this time.   The waitress never once apologized for any of her errors, the delay, nothing.  nada.  zilch.  Worst service I have ever gotten.  Rude.  Rude.  Rude.

Such a shame as it served some of the best dishes in New York minus the hype and insane prices. Truly, the food I've had here was comparable to the top restaurants in NY as Wesley is trained in molecular gastronomy. Even my friend who is a chef himself was a fan. I've dined here ordering just a la carte but I've also done the tasting menu a couple times. Each plate is stellar and the service is excellent. The wine list is also very good.

But the sweet offerings on the menu (french toast, even the lauded Jesus cake falls short of its potential). I'll go back though for the warm bankie. Sweet, sweet polenta, mushrooms, and asparagus.

We started with some spicy pickles for an appetizer. YUMMY! Great for those who are on a budget also! Service was quick and friendly.

And their banh mi sandwiches are uh-mazing. I've tried the beef bulgogi, BBQ pork, lemongrass chicken, kakuni pork belly, the Joju, and the Joju Monster. They're all really good but my favorite is the Joju, followed by the beef bulgogi. I don't care much to have the green sauce because the sandwiches are tasty enough and I think the green sauce just makes it unnecessarily too spicy (even though I usually like spice). The sandwiches are pre-cut in half for you and are very large so you can definitely swap for the other half of a different banh mi with a friend to try different flavors, or even just eat half and be full. The drinks are pretty good as well. I like how they give a 10% student discount if you have your student ID.

So when taking my daughter and her fiance on a pizza quest I naturally had to stop in my old neighborhood and sample a slice from Anellio's, which wasn't there anymore. Instead Peppino's Brick Oven Pizzeria now occupies the location. I quickly looked up the comments on Yelp and saw that it was rated very high. Inside did not resemble anything from the old business. It does not resemble the familiar take style counter near the entrance, but rather a sit down set up. The Brick oven is now in the back in plane sight. We were greeted by a hostess and opted to take the Pizza to go. We ordered the Margarita with Meatballs. We sat at a table while we waited the the young girl brought us to go cups of water. Very nice touch. Within a few minutes our Pizza was ready. Brick ovens do cook very quickly. The Pizza looked and tasted fantastic. Sauce was sweet and fresh, the Mozzarella was fresh not the commercial shredded type, the meatballs were sliced homemade. The crust was thin, but not too thin. Not burned as most brick oven pizza can be. Texture of the crust was light, not chewy, with just the right amount of pull as you bite. Overall and excellent PIE. Good Service. My neighborhood still Rocks Great Pizza!",9,7,7,5
287,15868,292,1/20/10,"The quality of the food combined with the reasonable prices make this place an all-around winner!   I dined with 3 people and was nervous that we might be in for a long wait based on other reviews.  (The place seats about 15-20 people total.)  However, I was able to make a reservation and when we arrived a party was just finishing.  We went across the street for a drink and received a call when our table was ready.  In total, we waited 15-20 minutes. As for the food, my meal was perfectly cooked. I had the hangar steak with a twice-baked potato, shared the baked brie, and sampled the lamb and brussel sprouts from my boyfriend's plate.  The most expensive entree was priced at $20, with most entrees around the mid-teens.",9,3,9,3

We were told the wait would be 15 min. We went to their sister bar down the street as they recommended- 30 minutes later we had no phone call. We went back to check on the status and were told the wait would be 25 mins more! We were told that it is difficult to estimate the time- which is no problem but they said it with such an unbelievable snotty attitude with no apology. The manager came out telling is it would be 10 min more... 20 min later we were sat. The hostess made a big deal about how she ""saved us a table"" like she had went so much out of her way- but at this point we had waited over an hr when we were told the wait time would be 15min. At no point did anyone throw out a simple sorry for your wait. And then when we ordered our three tapas and two drinks the waiter  told us  in a condescending  way it was a really small amount and not enough food- he recommended 4-6 tapas a person. Are you kidding me? We would have burst at the seams- we were more than full. Anyways over all good food terrible stuck up service.",3,8,3,8

The outdoor seating in the back is nice on a warm evening, more relaxed and a little quieter for talking with friends. Entrees average around $20 and I think you get what you pay for - it's not the cheapest, but for New York it is very reasonable for the quality of food, good service, and nice but casual ambience. Portions are good, we all only ordered pasta dishes and shared one dessert between 3 girls, and were quite full - although I suppose it was an early dinner and I was not ravenous when I arrived. Bread and olive oil to start are good and tasty, and the ravioli was yummy as well. The tiramisu was served in a cup, which did not make for the nicest presentation and it was on the smaller side, but it was satisfying. All in all, a solid choice for catching up with a few friends over a good meal. Will definitely be back!",7,3,6,4

The french toast is awesome, and a great choice for brunch if you like sweet and fresh. The fries are amazing and so is their buffalo chicken sandwich. Love the cocktails. Great service!",9,7,8,6
293,24552,79,12/13/12,"I would leave The City if this restaurant ever closed. One of my all time favorite places, I would come here alone, with a group or a date. I have never had a bad meal or have ever received bad service in the years I have been dining at Blue Ribbon, including their sister stores in Mid Town and Brooklyn. To fully enjoy what Blue Ribbon has to offer, you need a hungry belly and some deep pockets. In other words, don't just go there to say you have been there. Make it an advance plan. Prepare for it. Go with the right people and I do not recommend going with more than a total of 4 guests. (It is small and cozy, large parties ruin that). Start with a great bottle of wine, red or white. Oysters, Clams, Saut√©ed Calamari,  New Orleans Shrimp, Bone Marrow, and the list goes on and on. Follow this by a reasonable salad to share with the table. During this time, the tempting bread sitting on the table itself can become an appetizer if you allow it, highly recommended if you can afford those carbs. If you decide to order the Rack of Lamb for dinner, remember it takes some time to cook it right, which is exactly how they do things here. Be patient, and continue to enjoy your company, your delicious appetizers and your wine. Or you can go the Lobster route, the Fried Chicken, Duck Breast, Pigeon or Hanger Steak, too name a few. You can not go wrong with the selection, but I do recommend not coming here just for their wonderful burger. Save that for when you sit at the bar for a 'quick one'. Then it is time to pick a dessert for no reason and indulge yourself it its sweet haven of a plate. Share one or two of these, and make them count. You belly will find a way to make room the second you take that first bite. Trust me. I have done this over a hundred times, and every time is like my first experience there. When the bill arrives, simply place your card on top and give it right back to the server. Have someone else fill in the tip and total and throw the receipt out, never glancing at it. Exit the restaurant and enjoy the rest of your evening out in the great City of New York.",9,6,9,6

To me, overall the entrees were too Americanized and lacked flavor but the biggest disappointment was the Chow Fun! The noodles texture felt like they had been saturated in water for far too long and then microwaved. I mean, honestly, how can General Tso chicken lack flavor???My husband really enjoyed the soup dumplings, but I cannot attest to those because all of them (even the crab ones) had pork inside of them and I don't eat pork. In fact, the food, at this restaurant was so bad that our meal ended, when I asked, ""are we just eating this food because we spent $60 and this doesn't seem like the type of restaurant that remove items off the bill""? I'll try another restaurant in NY Chinatown, eventually, but it won't be this place!",2,7,2,7

The place was smaller than I thought but still a decent size. More of a place to sit and drink and talk with friends, as there really isn't a dance floor.  People sat at the bar, or a  few tables aligned behind it, or in the small section of couches (where we sat). Me and a girlfriend went to the bar to get our drinks since the rest of our group had our waitress super busy and the bartender was very friendly. He took his time explaining the drinks to us and even let us sample a couple. Lychee martini- verryyy yummy. a After 10pm the martinis start at $7. Still not a bad investment.

297,15920,315,12/23/14,BOTTOM LINE: Excellent authentic Greek food. The only downside is that it's not a restruant and they don't accept credit card. I would go there much more often if they accepted cards and if I could sit down to eat there I'd go much more frequently. But if you're craving a true Greek meal you can't find better in Manhattan.

The pork xiaolongbao were really good, with plenty of juice.  The pork and crab xiaolongbao wasn't bad, but what really stood out there was a less ""gritty"" texture than most other places that serve this -- wonder if the pork to crab ratio is higher here to make it that way.  The scallion pancake was solid, and the pork that went with the shanghai rice cakes were noticeably fattier than expected to give it an extra flavor kick. I wasn't sure what to expect service-wise after reading other yelpers' experiences, but my group didn't have any problems at all.  I suppose 2 things were in our favor: we got in just after opening on a Monday, and we mustered up our ABC-Mandarin to order and weren't bothered about anything we didn't ask for.

It's cool, casual and I'd love to return on a warm summer evening to sit outside.  Another fine dining find placed in a chill scene. I've been here once, they state the menu changes daily (propio come Chez Panisse?) and the food is awesome.  Their portions are decent sized, appetizers and sides a must to share.  For a party of five on a Saturday evening, three appetizers two sides entrees and one shared dessert are more than enough.  The constant is great flavor.  There's an awesome olive oil flavor throughout, the proteins are cooked to perfection, the JW chicken is really good, with some nice touch surprises like garbanzos with the calamari and cooked hazelnuts amongst the brussel sprouts.   They have a really good value list of old and new world wines, a bar that serves up some signature cocktails and I believe beers on tap.

I sat down at the bar and enjoyed a Stella.  What could make this better, I asked...And there was the answer..hard boiled eggs!  At the bar!  I looked at the menu, everything looked delicious, but we had reservations elsewhere.  I made the mental note and vowed to myself that I would return.  I had then forgotten the name of the restaurant, and remembered it only as ""the place with the hardboiled eggs at the bar"". Several months later I returned for more eggs and drinks.  I tried to get a table, but to no avail; they were full.  This went on for quite some time.  And apparently booking 2 weeks in advance is not far enough. Fast forward....So during a funfilled Saturday, my wonderful boyfriend proposed at the Belvedere in central park (Of course I said yes) and followed it up with, YES, you guessed it, dinner at Balthazar!   He did book the table a month in advance , and they only had 2 time slots available, 6 and 10..something to keep in mind when booking a table. We arrived around 5.30, and tried to get a seat at the full bar for some cocktails and eggs before dinner.  While waiting for a seat we ordered some cocktails, I had a French 75, he had a Tomas.  His was eh, mine was delicious.  The bartenders were very professional.  We finally got a seat at the bar...but the eggs were so far away :(  Before I was able to get the bartenders attention to get me the eggs, our table was ready.  oh well. We started off with the warm goat cheese and carmelized onion tart, followed by the chicken liver and fois gras mousse.  Both were phenominal. For dinner he had the duck shepards pie.  It was unreal.  You would think a dish like that would be greasy, but nope, it was perfect.  I had the grilled branzini.  I have to say that I have never had a fish cooked that perfect in my life.   We ended with the creme brulee, it was great. Throughtout the meal out server was great, she kept bringing the French 75s. This was by far one of the best meals I have had in a while.

It's better to order it as naked meatballs because, I also ordered a spicy pork meatball sandwich(heros) with whole wheat bread. But the bread masks the beautiful delicacy of the meatballs. The heros come with a beautiful arugla and sweet apple slice salad with a excellent salad sauce.

This was probably the best basil fried rice I've had in a long time (sorry DC..but its something you just don't do well). I loved the basil flavor with a hint of spice. I HAD to take away a star from this place though because the service at the end of the meal...ridiculously pushy. Like they guy stood over my girl and asked ""Check ready now?""

324,19314,65,5/16/12,"UPDATE: I wrote my first review (below) about a year and a half ago. I decided it was finally time to revisit an old staple. This evening I opted for some new things and was pleasantly surprised. -The chicken samosas are delicious- like insanely so, but I knew that. -Lamb saag (Lamb with spinach), just barely a hint of spice and not overly savory as can often be the case with this dish. (I will def. order this again) -Goat jalfreeze was spicier but not what I would call spicy. The vegetables (pepper and onions) were cooked to a satisfying crunch -Peshwari Naan wasn't the absolute best but pretty good in comparison to others I've had over the years in NYC. Given tonight's performance I'm going to up my overall rating from 3 stars to 4. Come on Gandhi- keep up the good work! In a city like NYC it's hard to make a restaurant work. It's even harder if your restaurant falls within one of the popular ethnic genres. Such is the downfall of Gandhi. Don't get me wrong, I live literally around the block and let's be real- there are not a lot of Indian (as in Southeast Asian) restaurants in Flatbush. Nevertheless, it's still NYC and I expect Indian food to be better than good here. So with that said. The food IS good...but great? Seriously people, it's not great. As I said I live right around the block so I have the advantage of writing a review based on multiple experiences. Allow me to share both the highs and lows of this establishment. Dining in. As many people have mentioned, very nice. Not so much because of the atmosphere (which is neither here nor there) but because of the service and hospitality. The owners are there all the time and they are truly wonderful people and very accommodating. The food. -If there is ONE thing that can be said to be awesome it is the chicken samosas. Seriously AWESOME. -The lamb biriyani is overall a little dry, they are sparse with the cilantro, nuts, etc. and the lamb could use some more succulence. -The chicken tika masala as other reviewers have noted is slightly off, the sauce is too thin and not quite as savory as it should be, also the chicken is a tad overcooked. -The nan- well this really depends on whether you're eating there or ordering in. When ordering in you can't expect too much, the steam is naturally going to soften the bread and make it a little rubbery I would suggest eating at the restaurant if your primary draw is the naan. The garlic naan is probably their best offering. -The lunch specials: I have ordered the curry shrimp lump special. Again not bad but not great. The curry sauce was medium flavored, personally I would have like more kick. Though at 8.95 I think the special should come with at least 6-8 shrimp (they are normal medium size) rather than 5 shrimps swimming in a cup and a half of sauce. If there is an upside to the lunch special, at least I can save the sauce to cook something else in. -The rice pudding is also good, though lacking in either cinnamon or cardamon flavor. -The gulab jamun should be softer. -Mango lassi is standard and enjoyable. The extras. They are generous with condiments, for some this may be a draw. Delivery is usually quick. Overall: If you're not an Indian food aficionado this place will more that satisfy your hunger cravings and taste requirements. If however, your palate has become used to a certain standard, as has mine living in this fine city Gandhi might come up dissappointing you. (Which is in fact not what you might expect from Gandhi...bad pun...couldn't help it)",4,3,4,3

I am not sure how long you have to wait for a table without reservation because this place can only fit 25 people.  Make sure check out their website.  Good thing about this place is that you can bring your own bottle and the bad thing is that this place only takes cash.  It is a very small restaurant but the food can wow you with a smile on your face.  As for appetizers we had pate de campagne maison and tartelette de chevre frais aux echalottes truffes raisin confit et voile de vieux gruyere (goat cheese tart with shallots truffles grape & a veil of 90 days aged swiss cheese.  I do recommend you to try the goat cheese tart.  As for the entree we had signature - seared hanger steak, roasted garlice and parsley sauce which was very delicious.  Also we had French cassoulet toulouse's style which was ok.  Too much bean and very fatty.  If you see all that meat (duck, bacon and pork sausage) combined with the  beans soaked in fatty oil you would probably be to full to finish the entire dish.  Ladies, I wouldn't suggest you try finishing this dish on your own unless you have a guy with you or you haven't eaten for many, many days.  I couldn't finish my dish.  I didn't really it.  I am not much of a bean person but I am a sweet person.  I saved my appetite for meringue, caramel, almonds and vanilla custard and I am glad I did.  It is lite and it tasted so delicious.  Parts of that dessert tasted like marshmellow.  I will come back again for the dessert.",8,7,8,7

The waitress was attentive but relaxed, and made excellent recommendations. Food was great.  We tried the cheese puffs (YUM), two of the salads (the duck and the chicken), and a creme brulee (just okay..a little liquid-y, not custard-y enough).  Just being nitpicky: the menu says that the duck salad includes ""plums"" and the chicken salad includes ""grapes.""  The fruit is dried, however, not fresh, so it should say ""prunes"" and ""raisins.""  So, not exactly what I was expecting, but they were still awesome salads. Wine list has depth and breadth, without being overwhelming.  Several options at each price point.  And the staff is knowledgeable but not condescending, which is a rare combination at wine bars. And they take credit cards!",8,6,8,7
330,12639,40,5/15/09,"Delicious food, ehhhh service. It was our first time to this restaurant and I was impressed by the decor. The ceiling was covered with clay pots, precariously suspended; the room was the typical New York restaurant, dimly lit and with strangers dangerously close to you (stranger danger! Okay, maybe I just don't like people). Apparently, there's a big table in the back where people just sit with strangers. How horrifying. We were lucky to get our own table without a reservation or a wait but, granted, it was also 10:30 at night and we still only got the second-to-last table. Now, for the service. Our waitress was not overly friendly and seemed to just cease paying attention at times. That's not so bad though because she could have been Russian or some sort of Eastern European and that's just her culture (Is ADD part of any culture?). She was clearly inattentive, except with the check. The worst part, though, was that we asked her for recommendations on the menu and she basically went through the menu and pointed out the most expensive dishes in each category. What. The. Hell. I, too, have the ability to identify which numbers are highest. It was very blatant and very annoying. We ended up tracking down and asking another server for recommendations which were, by the way, completely different and completely delicious. We started with the anginares moussaka (something involve artichoke hearts and cheese). It was decadent and delicious. My boyfriend thought it was a little too rich for his taste, but I loved it. I had the cod which was delicious but I think the real winner was the pastitso that my boyfriend got. I call it the winner because the tables on both sides of us got the same dish so it was apparently very popular. It tasted a little like lasagna (bleh) gone Greek to me, but everyone else seemed to love it so I guess it should be highly recommended. i would also suggest wine with dinner (would have been perfect but I supposed to be studious right now) and dessert because they looked fabulous -- I was just too stuffed to order any :( Overall, I gave it a 4 because the food was great; we just got stuck with a crappy server. I would go back (but request another server). Oh, and reservations are definitely recommended!",6,7,6,7

332,149917,849,10/22/14,"Situation: After an unsuccessful hunt for gloves at Macy's (I wanted to go to Nordstrom Rack instead, but my friend insisted on Macy's aka the ""terrible-service-tourist-trap""), we headed over to MEW Izakaya for some dinner. Everything I knew about MEW I had gotten from skimming its Yelp right before heading over there, so I had only a gist of what to expect. We got 2 orders of miso ramen, 1 order of dragon roll sushi, and 1 fish-type of dish which we chose at random off of the specials menu. I also got a shochu on the rocks, bringing our total to $50, pre-tax/tip. PROS -Food was decent. In order of how it was served: Shochu (nice and strong), Dragon Roll (delicious!), Miso Ramen (good, but not phenomenal), Fish Special (also good, but not particularly notable). -Location is conveniently near Koreatown (for boba/dessert or karaoke afterwards, perhaps?) and Penn Station (for if you're a commuter). -Waiters were well-spirited and patient. Mine took the time to explain the subtle differences of each drink to me. CONS -Not gonna lie, this place looks a lot more quaint in photos than it does in real life. I would describe the decor as SO mismatched and worn-out that it actually somehow becomes oddly chic. Ah, the power of a DSLR camera and a sepia filter... -We came in around 7 on a Monday night and it was packed, with a queue almost to the door! Definitely didn't expect that. Can't imagine how it must be on the weekends, yikes. We waited for about 20 minutes before being seated. In a nutshell... Cute place, might come back.

The udon noodles was so fresh and the soup broth was tasty. i wish i would've had an empty stomach when i came, nevertheless, i still enjoyed the food. The ambiance felt as if i was in Japan.

The pork buns were so delicious with the right amount of flavors. The Matcha Brulee was torched too long and it was hard so we sent it back and tried the 2nd one. It was much better.

It was so flavorful and fresh.  The souffle was also excellent.  If you get the full size souffle, only add about half of the raspberry sauce b/c it doesn't need the whole thing.",8,5,8,5

The decor is just as beautiful and magical as the other reviewers mention, and the service was courteous and super quick. And now for the food - WOW. Between two of us, we got and can recommend: - thai iced coffee - thai iced tea (I usually stick to water, but both the iced tea and iced coffee were just delicious - the mason jars they came in also made each the perfect amount) - papaya salad - really fresh, sour, tangy, and came with chicharron - pad thai with crispy duck - solid dish - I would get it spicy next time - chef's claypot special - I would definitely recommend this dish, with minimal complaints: the meat/seafood medley on top was a little too salty and too much chicken/not enough seafood. However, the rice on the bottom of the claypot was incredible. I'd get it again and again and again for the rice. On top of the excellent food, the price was totally reasonable and worth every bite. Definitely recommend and will definitely be back.",7,9,7,9

I had both lunch and breakfast here and both times I was bowled over. LUNCH: We arrived slightly earlier than our initial reservation and since both of us needed to rush back to the office after lunch, decided to check if we could move our reservation earlier. The restaurant was booked but we realized that they also had walk-in tables at the bar and decided to claim a spot. The most awesome thing of all was the acknowledgement by the manager of the change in arrangements and he actually took it upon himself to find out whether they had made a mistake with the reservation timings - to which we simply explained that it was not them, but us. BUT talk about a WOW customer service experience indeed! I loved their small plates serving size. We had the tripe, suckling pig ragu, and thought the olive oil cake was simply divine! BREAKFAST: I had a friend visit NYC and I insisted that Maialino would have to be on her itinerary. So we came by despite it being a rainy morning that greatly delayed our appearance at the restaurant. Nevertheless, we were treated with the same WOW experience as the first. I ordered a pain chocolat and was served this most awesome glazed croissant - which I thoroughly enjoyed but when I asked a passing waitress to confirm if that was indeed a pain chocolat, she DID NOT hesitate to serve me the right one - no questions asked. I don't know how they do it but such WOW service seems to be exuding from each and every one of the staff here. I can only attribute it to the great job the manager and management team have done with the place and their staff and while I have a special place for Eleven in my heart, Maialino is a gem of a restaurant to me - Good job Danny Meyer, you've done it again!",9,9,9,9

The seating arrangement was sushi bar meets teppanyaki grill meets chefs table.  Wifey and I tried the 5 course chef's tasting menu.  Our waitress and the kitchen were accommodating enough that they let us have different dishes instead of being served the same dish for each course.  So essentially we got to taste 10 different dishes on the menu.   Needless to say that the food was amazing with unique flavors and well prepared dishes.  I would've given this joint 5 stars.  However, the service which included the waitresses and kitchen staff were cold and stuffy.  They weren't horrible, just not friendly.

Tsukune no longer comes with a quail egg, previously standard at Totto as is at all other robataya's. Tsukune was bone dry, quite the disappointment. I asked if they served quail eggs and the waitress said they no longer serve them. Avocado and tuna salad, not previously on the menu,  was guacamole with tuna shoved in the middle. Home made hot tofu no longer on the menu. Chicken cartilage not even cooked thought. Pork in ponzu and scallion was tough as rubber. The service was clumsy.

I was also informed by my friends, who are nearing completion of culinary school, that for a ""french omelet"" is was nowhere near runny enough, in fact, it wasn't runny at all.

The calamari were actually large slices, not your typical rings, which was great. Not too chewy with a great bite. Tiger shrimp were marinated nicely & not overcooked. The Hanger steak wasn't anything special -  the pieces of were too big and overcooked. The bacon wrapped pork was flat, if you can imagine.

The focus in this place is on food and nothing else. The Food: I ordered the fried chicken box and chose the collard greens as my side. I was amazed at how fast my food came out, seemed like it was less than 5 minutes. Not only was it served fast but it was fresh out of the fryer. - The collard Greens were surprisingly solid. They were cooked perfectly.. Not under or over cooked. The flavor was good, could have used a little more salt or perhaps more pork in the pot when they boil it but they are defiantly working with something when it comes to their greens. - The Chicken exceeded every expectation I had. Simply put, PERFECTION. I repeat, this chicken was perfect. The skin was so crisp you can hear the crunch from 3 tables away and the inside was surprisingly moist. Taste wise it was like the skin and the inside of the chicken had two unique flavors. The skin was perfectly seasoned, the salt was JUST right. This chicken is a 10 in the flavor and texture department.  Arguably the best fried chicken I've had in any restaurant, Samantha's in bed stuy is the only competition. -The biscuit was also good. The honey butter they offer goes perfectly with it. I Probably wouldn't come here with out getting a biscuit. Overall Pies n thighs is a solid 4 to 4.5. I can't give them the 5 because Samantha's southern holds the crown in Brooklyn as far as the entire soul food meal goes. But none the less pies n thighs is on point and I'll Probably be there more often than Samantha's because the location is more conducive to other things I do in manhattan.",8,7,8,7

The service here is fantastico. I absolutely love the people here. Everyone was polite. We had about 10 people waiting on our table. My gf and I ordered the same thing which was zuppa di zucca, Gamba di pollo, and torta di olio. Portion seem small but I left satisfied. Each dish came out in a timely manner and tasted delightful. Yes the dessert is really simple but I didn't want anything too sweet. The decor was simple yet beautiful. There is coat check available so you don't look uneasy at the table.

My friend and I arrived fairly late at 9:30 and still there was a 40 minute wait for a table of 2 (only in NYC...). But the place is fairly small, and packed. You really have to squeeze by tables and chairs to get anywhere. I wouldn't recommend groups larger than 4-6. As we were waiting we grabbed margaritas at the bar, they were alright. It was $8 for one. When we sat down we ordered 5 tacos and guacamole. We had the lamb, pork, steak, fish, and chorizo. They were all delicious at $3 per taco. They were a good size for a taco too. They were all quite flavorful, the lamb was my favorite. The guacamole was was alright, slightly bland and plain. Not worth $7 if you ask me. Will definitely be back to eat more tacos and try some other dishes.",7,5,6,5

367,85164,837,2/7/08,"Uva is a bright spot amidst the culinary wasteland that is the UES.  This is, to be cliched, a cozy, dim, romantic wine bar that is very inviting, with good service.  As others have said, Uva is what you make it--you can come in and sit at the bar and order flatbreads, cheeses, and antipasti, or you can sit at a table and have a fully coursed meal. Uva has a nice wine list with some good values and we enjoyed our bottle of wine.  We started with some cheese and salad--I had a huge plate of Parmegiano Reggiano, well kept and presented.  The duck carpaccio was also very good.  Entrees were also quite tasty--I particularly remember the luganega, a sausage dish done in garlic with grilled polenta.  Desserts were nice as well. Uva's not reinventing the wheel here with its more traditional general Italian cuisine, but it does what it does well, which is all one can ask of a neighborhood place.  It can be a bit tight, which lends itself to overhearing lots of faux-Sex and the City wannabe-type conversations, but if you live on the UES, that's something you must be used to by now.  A great date place.   Ciao",9,5,9,5
368,95195,467,1/31/08,"Umm...given that this spot is for ""Employees Only,"" I guess the waiters and bartenders in New York City must be doing pretty well for themselves these days (what with the rampant Chanel purses and tanned breast implants and other slightly seedy markers of conspicuous wealth)? Oh, come on. ""Employees Only?"" Who are they kidding! This place (even on a Wednesday night) is a meat-market with freshly bottled blonds swinging on the hooks, just waiting for their Corporate Daddy to call in his order to the butcher...(um, or something. You get the idea.) That said, the drinks were absolutely solid (more of the same speak-easy delectableness of Little Branch or PDT or Death and Co. etc., and about the same price--$13 a pop). I particularly enjoyed the Amelia (blackberries and vodka might be a new favorite!) and Ginger Splash (we are talking MAJOR ginger kick here). (For comparison: the strawberries-champagne-and-gin Fraise Sauvage was underwhelming, especially against the Amelia, and the West Sider tasted like watery lemon-lime Gatorade.) On the food end of things, the arugula salad's dressing was indeed hazlenutty, and the bread, served with some sort of whipped butter amazingness, was delightfully warm and hearty. Our waitress was a dear, the host a hysterical vision in his old-timey vest, and the busboys remarkably prompt when refilling my water glass (a challenge since I was dehydrated from consuming far too many BBQ Baked Lays before arriving--I swear those things are laced with something, no really I'm not even kidding, even if it's just the salt, I mean I will lick my fingers clean...oh man I wonder if I can find them somewhere for lunch?...but I digress). Hearken close, ladies and gentlemen: the piece de resistance here is the back room. I have fallen in love. The bar area was crowded and making me feel dejected (not to mention rejected, since I was apparently offensive in wearing my Obama t-shirt, jeans, and Uggs)...but the tables in the back were cozy without being crowded, and looked out onto such a sweet space.

I've been to a couple burger joints where friends and family members raved about but none of those places left an impression until I tried an Umami Burger. Considering it just opened in NYC, a 20 minute wait was not too bad. This place seriously changed my life. I ordered the duck burger from the ""secret menu."" The duck was cooked to perfection at medium rare. One of the ingredient which really stuck out to me was the sweet apple compote. It was a great component to go with the duck. The burger was so juicy and moist, I didn't even want to chew it. I just wanted to stuff everything in my mouth. It was so tasty! My boyfriend ordered the truffle burger (medium rare). It was fresh and juicy, more savory compared to the duck burger. We also ordered sweet potato fries. It was sprinkled with a little bit of brown sugar to go with the 3 complimentary home made sauces. My personal favorite was what seemed to be truffle mayo with the combination of their homemade ketchup. What I also love about this place is the use of steak instead of ground beef in their burgers. This equates to better quality meat, which makes it more safe to eat if you prefer your protein pink. The day I had an umami burger was the day I began to love burgers (only umami burgers for now). I will definitely be back for more burgers. Umami Burger, thank you for coming to the East Coast!",9,8,9,8

I had the salmon and tried several of the appetizers. the vegetable and pesto soup was delicious as was the grilled asparagus. I tried the beet and gorgonzola cheese salad and wasn't that impressed but I think thats because I am not that fond of beets. The salmon was just ok, nothing special.

The food is tasty Korean home-cooking - not the best in K town but definitely the best for the price and quality combined.

I am originally from the neighborhood (back tin the 70s - 80s). I still visit on occasion, quite often actually.  I was keen on trying this place out, since Rocky's is the only option and that is, well, blah.   I walked in and ordered two pies to go...a Caton Park and the other I can't remember.  We waited (and waited) for the pies.  When one of the very friendly staff walked pies over to us, they were not our pies.  When we finally did get our pies, I raced back around the corner (E. 10th St.) to dig in.  THEY WERE COLD!  C'mon, guys, really? What kind of irritated me was, while I was waiting for my pies, I asked for a side of anchovies.  No worries, I would have paid for the side.  I was told ""um, we don't do that"".  How can you offer take out and not offer anchovies?  OK, I know I am one of the few folks that actually like anchovies, but really?   The price isn't bad, but considering what you get (a small pie, and in my case cold) it just isn't worth it.  I really do hope these folks make it, because it is nice to see Church Ave get some life back into it.  In reading these reviews it seems like the bartenders were serving Kool-aide at the bar.  Ok, sorry about that joke.  But if you want really good pizza and you are not a hipster from Ohio and can deal with Staten Island, go to Joe & Pat's on Victory Blvd.  Now that is pizza.

Not really there for the music but it helps to have variety. Food came fast. Ordered catfish appetizer, one cocktail and glass of Riesling. Also ordered 2lbs of shrimp with corn and potatoes. I give the food 3 stars. Nothing special. But I guess that's because I'm creole and know what real Cajun food is supposed to taste like. The atmosphere was okay. Got crowded a bit but nothing over the top. A little over an hour after our stay, one of the managers comes over and asks us if we would like our check. My friend jokingly asks ""are you kicking us out?"" And he replies ""I'm trying to be nice about it. We have a 3 hour wait"". I was immediately turned off. I've never been told that before. I've also worked in customer service almost 10 years...and of course eaten at plenty of restaurants. Never had this happen before. People pay for food AND experience. I can understand if we were there over 2.5-3 hours. But that was unacceptable. Having a 3 hour wait is not my problem. Portions were also on the small side. Riesling was great, cocktail was mediocre and overpriced. Doubt I'll be coming back.",3,4,2,4
404,6382,186,5/28/14,"I had brunch here a couple of weeks ago, in their beautiful backyard. The food was AMAZING! The service was as always, on point. The owner is the nicest guy and has managed to get a staff that reflects his approach. I came with a group and I occasionally get ""order envy"" at restaurants when I see the plates come to the table, but everything here was delicious. Loved it. Will be back.",9,7,9,7
405,30635,292,3/1/13,"This place is really cute. It has good ambiance and the food was good....but the service sucked, hence two stars. I came here last Sunday to meet up a friend for dinner and catch up.  I arrived early and the restaurant was empty, except for one other table with a group of four, presumably because it was Oscar night. The waitress asked if I wanted a drink while I waited and even answered some questions I had about the menu, but that's where the attentiveness ended. When my friend finally showed up, the restaurant was still empty and it took the waitress literally 20 minutes to even take out drink orders.  It may have taken even longer had i not flagged her down. This theme continued throughout the meal. The two waitresses/hostesses were engaged in idle banter at the counter the entire time we were seated and barely bothered to even look our way. Tis is unacceptable.  Considering the restaurant is small and wasn't busy, there's no excuse for the delay in service and lack of attention. Due to the poor service, I probably wouldn't come back here again.",3,6,2,7
406,35842,577,11/25/14,"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for soup so we decided to try this place. There are no waiters, so you seat yourself and place your order and pick it up at the counter. The restaurant offers free tea next to the counter (self-service of course). We ordered the beef stew noodle soup, saut√©ed chicken noodles, scallion pancakes, boiled pork and cabbage dumplings and a pork bun. My favorites were the dumplings and pork bun. Both had very good flavor. The pork bun tasted like a dumpling, except for the white, soft bun. The bun soaked up the gravy from the pork. It was so delicious that I took one to go. I wasn't as impressed with the beef stew noodle soup, saut√©ed chicken noodles and the scallion pancakes. The soup base had a good taste (a little sweet). The noodles were hand-pulled, which was a plus. You can actually watch them pull the noodles next to the kitchen. However, the noodles were a little doughy for me. The meat in both dishes were a little dry. The chicken was sliced very thin, making it easy to overcook  it. The saut√©ed noodles dish was lacking in taste and was a tad on the oily side. The scallion pancakes were already made and sitting under the heat lamp; unfortunately the pancakes were not warm at all.",5,3,4,5

Eggs Benedict are nicely done, if a little short on hollandaise (solve that by ordering extra).  Once, however, my poached eggs were overcooked (not runny).  The fruit salad is beautiful and delicious.  They have a full bar for those who like a bloody mary, mimosa or other to accompany the meal.  Service is speedy, if a little curt.  I've also had dinner here and found the food, and sangria, very good.  Cafe Luluc is a regular in our rotation. ETA: One thing I dislike here is how quickly they clear away your plates.  Granted, lots of places in NYC do this - whisk the plates away before you even put down your fork from the last bite. But, it needs to stop.  It makes you feel rushed out.  Luluc, help lead the charge to end this practice.",6,5,7,6

414,28700,725,1/25/12,"First impression when I walked in was - this place is way too small, has the ugliest chairs, and the most basic table settings. The dishes didn't match and they look like they were bought at a thrift store. But that did not matter when my service began almost immediately. I was greeted right away by friendly staff. I was asked what I wanted to drink. It came right away. My Sierra Mist arrived in a can! This is where I was wondering why I had chose this place as my birthday dinner spot. As all of this was happening, the small restaurant just started filling up more and more with people. Some of them even seemed to be regulars. And then my dreaded views of II Corallo Trattoria changed when my pesto tortellini arrived. It was out of this world! The pesto wasn't overpowering, and the pasta was pretty much perfect. It was a bit on the al dente side, but that was okay. We also shared a pizza as an appetizer before our main dishes arrived. It was baked in a brick oven and was delicious. So, there it goes to show you that a restaurant on Spring Street in the village that you may be expecting to be at least $30-40 a person does not necessarily mean could be horrible. Sometimes you need to give the little guys some support. They will forever have me coming back for more and more!",8,7,7,6

Great ambiance (if you sit in their covered, heated garden room), great bartender, great drinks, good service and delicious food, especially the gnocci with wild mushrooms which was earthy and delightful.  The gnocci was light and fluffy but rich.  Pappardelle was also very tasty.  Two of us had the swordfish special while our hubbies had the duck breast special.   Swordfish was good, not great; duck breast was pretty good.  We only ordered 2 desserts, the ricotta cheesecake and gelato.  Cheesecake was good; gelato was 2 small scoops.  I didn't taste the gelato so can't comment on it.  Just a pretty place to enjoy a good dinner.",7,3,6,5
416,40104,133,7/15/09,"Considering that I'm a Crown Heights local (and trust me Crown Heights locals still consider Washington Ave. part of Crown Heights and I'll be damned if any broker can convince me that for a 2-3 block stretch between Crown Heights and Park Slope lies a mystical, magical  gem known as ""Prospect"" Heights.  Get off it.)  Anyway...considering that I'm a Crown Heights local I was surprised to never have been to this place in all my years here.  My mother actually introduced me to the place last year.  As everyone has said the owner is really nice.  The orange slices and cookies are great.  The ambience is totally funky with the vintagey vibe and the floral disguise outside (you wouldn't even know there was a diner inside).  The Lemon Ricotta pancakes are fantastic.  As a matter of fact I recommend any style of pancake for the simple fact that they serve it with 3 different flavors of butter.  Yum.  Yes, the owner closes very early and they are closed on Sundays.  No complaints here....just saying...you should make a note of it.",7,8,6,6
417,23270,524,9/30/14,"Brisket sandwich is to die for.  Maybe a tad dry but that's my fault for not getting off my butt and asking for a little more sauce. Beans were very good. Generous hunks of meat and a just-right spicy sauce.   Potatoes??? Not so much....expected them to be crunchy and they were limp and soggy despite the fact that they looked like they cooked the hell out of them. There was a duct running across the ceiling that was dripping water across several tables.  WTH? I cannot complain about that too much because we just found a table outside and it did not impact the quality of the food (which is the whole point of a restaurant review, right?). So, if you are in the East Village and looking for some really good BBQ, Mighty Quinn's is the place to go.",7,7,6,8
418,1132,771,8/12/08,"It was a warm summer night as we danced amongst the crowd.  Pier 54 on the Hudson River was filled with the sounds of salsa and the sight of couples twirling each other about.  Music was in the air as a warm breeze trailed behind our little trio as we left in search of food. We agreed to Cuban fare to keep the theme going.  We decided upon a cozy place that was aptly named Cuba.  Upon entrance to the main dining room, I wasn't very impressed.  It was just a tighly packed restaurant that was doing good business on a beautiful night. Our hostess led us to the back and behold, we'd come upon an incredibly romantic little nook. White sheets draped across the ceiling as candlelight flickered it's warm glow.  Cuba would make a great date spot if you were to be seated in this back room.  Although we were all together as friends, we appreciated how conducive the space could be with another... We could've had the classic mojito, but we decided to go for a pitcher of Caipirinha instead.  Although the pitcher would've been finished, we made sure we drank every single drop because this pitcher cost us $50!  Yes, I said $50.  I was expecting maybe $30, no higher than $32, but I guess I was wrong... As we weren't very hungry, we decided to share a variety of items.  First were the Tostones Rellenos, stuffed fried green plantains.  I love tostones, but these were fried just a bit too hard to my liking.  Tostones should be fried, then taken out and smashed and fried again.  Biting into one should give you a crunchy outer layer with a starchy inner layer.  These tostones with their shrimp tomato sofrito filling were just hard, hard, hard.  It almost hurt my jaw to chew them. Next up were the Papas Rellenas, fried stuffed potatoes with beef picadillo or cheese.  We chose beef.  These are another favorite of mine.  Imagine beef picadillo, enveloped by a mound of fluffy mashed potatoes, coated in breadcrumbs and fried.  When we cut into one, we realized that we had gotten a cheese one.  Hoping it was a mistake, we cut into the second one, which ending up being cheese as well.  When we pointed out that we had ordered beef, they graciously told us to keep the ones we had and try them while they corrected our order. Unfortunately, both versions of the papas rellenas were bland and understuffed.  A bit more salt and pepper could have brought these so much furthur.  I personally enjoy them with a bit of annatto oil in the potatoes for not only a hint of flavor, but color as well... Next up was the Ceviche Mixto aka the mixed seafood ceviche.  Squid rings, shrimp and bits of scallops served with thin plantain chips.  This could've been made better with a more varied variety of seafood (I'm pretty sure it was mainly squid rings with bits of shrimp and maybe one piece of scallop.) and less of the lettuce filler. Our final dish was the Paella Valenciana, saffron rice mixed with shrimp, scallops, squid, clams, mussels, baby pork ribs, Spanish chorizo and chicken.  Although this dish arrived in a paella pan, upon touch you'd know that it wasn't cooked in it.  As I dug in, I found that there was not much digging to do.  Had the paella actually been cooked in the pan, the crusty layer of soccarat that could have developed would've been the only bit of rice in the pan.  How would there be enough rice to accompany the meat and seafood in the dish? Overall, the food at Cuba was distinctly meh.  There is no better word to describe it as it's not terrible, but I probably wouldn't go back anytime soon either.  This place really only deserved 2.5 stars, but I'll round up for the cozy back room.",5,7,6,7

420,7107,889,8/10/12,"MY 500th REVIEW, for your consideration: An unassuming entrance on the corner of Jane and 8th Avenue leads into a crowded and dark space with ""townies"" enjoying a drink at the bar, dark wood-laden walls, and awkwardly arrainged tables covered with white paper, a glass full of chubby crayons on top of each for the pleasure of the more artistic customers. This reminded me of the some of the restaurants I used to frequent back home, as a child, and the nostalgia came flooding back. This felt less like a New York City restaurant (and even much less like a quinessential West Village restaurant), and more like the old (and sadly gone) Owl's Nest in Norfolk, CT, for example. The 5 year old came out of me, beat up the 27 year old (supposedly) sophisticated young woman that I am, and I had a chunky green Crayola crayon in my hand before I knew it, drawing a palm tree. Oh, and I suppose there was food there, too... They boast a pretty standard menu. There are your typical pastas, salads, meats, and burgers. I went for the grilled chicken on toasted brioche, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. The chicken was perfectly grilled. The ratio of arugula to the rest of the sandwich was not overwhelming. (I HATE when too many greens complicate a sandwich.) The amount of pesto and goat cheese complimented the sandwich nicely, and the brioche was nicely toasted to a garlicky, buttery finish. I was extremely satisfied. The small bowtie pasta salad that came on the side was a nice alternative to French fries. My friend got the basic burger and fries, and it looked delicious. She complimented the chef for cooking it perfectly medium, as she had asked. Goodness knows not enough people actually pay attention when doing such a thing... The crowd of patrons was diverse. There were many ""Oh, they don't live in NYC, do they? Perhaps they are here from Putnam County?"" types, along with families eating large meals together, older established couples enjoying beers and eggplant parm while talking on their cell phones circa 2004, and a few young Yuppie couples sprinkled in here and there. It's a great place to people watch, and even more fun to listen to their cell phone conversations. Though I wouldn't make this a regular stop, most likely, I am glad I went. Solid food coupled with jolts of intense childhood nostalgia are always welcomed. P.S.: There is a good Scoutmob deal here! Paying $20 for a dinner for two sets up an intense feeling of euphoria inside both my brain AND my stomach.",8,4,7,5

422,5071,727,1/15/10,"Returned today for the grilled skirt steak sandwich. I liked it more then the pork belly which I had on my first visit. The steak was perfectly charred and crispy on the outside, but pink and juicy inside. Carrots, cucumbers, some greens and the not too mayo-ey sauce accompany the crunchy toasted roll. This sandwich is a dollar or two more then the others but worth it, and still came in under $10. This time I went upstairs to eat. No frills, but clean counter and very casual and communal vibe. There is also a PA up there so you can hear when they call your #. A tube of Sriracha and napkins sit every 2-3 barstools, and they also have regular tap water and cups if you don't feel like paying for bottled water.",7,4,8,3

I call it a cafeteria because you basically order all your food from a window, they give you a table number and they bring it to you when it's ready. It was a little confusing at first, but I like ordering at my own pace. A little grimy since it's a bar at night and they serve a lot of finger foods. I had the sir racha chicken wings which were really tasty. My husband had the shrimp burger and loved it. We'll be back!",8,4,7,3

Our (new-ish?) waitress was outstanding and despite being packed, made us feel as if we were the only table in the restaurant.

I has the Mac and cheese for appetizer, chicken for dinner, and coconut flan for dessert. The staff were friendly.

Brought my friend here the other night for drinks and dessert to celebrate his birthday. I wanted to get everything on the dessert menu but we showed some self control and just got the bourbon pecan pie sundae and the pumpkin monkey bread with pumpkin ice cream. If you haven't had monkey bread before then do yourself a favor and try it. Better yet, try it here. It's basically like a cinnamon roll shaped like a muffin that breaks off into soft pillowy pieces. Definitely up there with my favorite desserts and here it's pumpkin flavored so it's a must get. I would advise getting your own since it's small and addicting. We made the mistake of sharing it, which created a bit of tension at the table. Ok maybe that was all in my head. The pumpkin ice cream that came with it created a perfect hot/cold pairing.  The bourbon pecan pie sundae was just as addicting and the portion was quite generous. It was filled with pecan pie pieces and will satisfy any sweet tooth out there. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better, they showed up at our table with a cupcake and candle for my friend to celebrate his birthday. I initially asked them if  they could stick a candle in one of the desserts we ordered, but they went above and beyond by bringing out a cupcake for him. We were already stuffed and on sugar overload, so I tried a tiny piece. I'm not a huge cupcake fan because I find most icing too sweet, but this one was moist, dense, and the perfect amount of sweet. Only issue I had was that the food took quite a long time to come out considering the place was practically empty. Other than that, service was friendly and fun was had. I'll definitely be back to try dinner.",7,3,6,4
431,46185,173,5/23/13,"I believe it was the band Foreigner that coined the term ""I wanna know what love is"". Well, Jack & Nellie's coined the theme of having great wine, great food, and great ambiance in Forest Hills. The selection of wine is classy and tasteful and the food is thoughtful and deliberate. I came here with my lovely girlfriend for a date. The place was cozy and romantic, we were seated next to the front windows where we watched an intense storm, with lightening and all. The background music was very nice, good mix of some old and new tunes, all of them helping to set a good mood for a date. The wine list had your sure bet European, South American and American wines. A healthy mix of pricey and affordable wines, choose to your liking. I ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. A nice smooth fruity up front taste with a crisp airy finish. If a wine doesn't get you at least a kiss after the first glass, I'd suggest getting a Pinot Noir. The food portions were perfect to casually eat without filling yourself to the point of hopeless stupidity and food coma. We split chorizo macaroni and cheese and lamb meatballs. The chorizo macaroni and cheese was a splendid, creamy and sinful. The chorizo was a welcomed bit of naughtiness on an otherwise angelic and innocent dish, spicy and sensual this dish pleased in calming whimsy. The lamb meatballs added a lively, brighter contrast to its heavier counterpart. The lamb meatball was tender, juicy, and begging for special attention. Between sips of sauvignon, the lamb enhanced the crisp finish of the wine. It was aromatic and refined the equivalent of what I imagine talking to a french speaking Bradley Cooper would be like. If you're around Forest Hills looking for a nice place to have a date night... this is the place you want to go. Trust me, it's hella romantic and the wait staff is considerate not to butt-in during a sincere moment of staring and hand holding. Great STUFF!",7,1,6,2

We ended up sitting up at the bar because the place was packed. It was nice enough for the waitress to put as at the end of the bar so it was convenient for us to talk and eat family style like we typically do at Chinese restaurants. There is a hook under the bar to hang our bags, which was cool. This gets rather loud but at least it's a talk-able noise level. We ordered the homestyle tofu, dan dan noodles, and the dry pot style beef. I would say all dishes were pretty good. My favorite out of the 3 would probably be the beef.  The noodles were really good, but the peanut sauce was strong. You won't notice it until you continue to eat it after eating something else. It wasn't so obvious when we were first given the dish. The good thing about this place is that it is actually spicy for Szechuan food unlike other places I've been to. I even needed the white rice at one point XD. Overall, pretty good :)",6,6,7,7

The Long Island Duck was delicious and the butternut squash risotto was to dye for.  A generous serving of spinach came with the duck.   I love chocolate so I had to get the flour less chocolate cake and it did not disappoint.  I brought the Creme br√ªl√©e home for my family to try and they all loved it.  My friend had a trio of desserts with the bread pudding which delicious and I'm not a huge bread pudding fan but I'd order it myself.  The chef makes all the desserts and they are delicious!

Many of the offerings were a bit heavy for our appetites so we chose to share one small and one large plate which turned out to be the right amount of food. The black sesame hummus was interesting, served with a good variety of very fresh veggies and the sesame worked to add a nuttier edge to standard hummus.  Fish n chips was another matter - as pictured across yelp it was a crispy fried whole fish (porgy) served atop thick-cut fries. Unfortunately the fish was very overcooked in oil that tasted burned and the fries were soggy with moisture from the fish. The only saving grace for the dish was a bit of punch added by two toppings, a yuzu chutney was drizzled over the fries and the fish had little mounds of roe. To sum up the experience, the creativity was there but execution fell short. I hope this was just an off night, but I don't plan to return except maybe for drinks in the pleasant backyard area.",4,2,2,5

My hubby and I shared the chicken katsu small size and it was the perfect amount.  The chicken cutlet was crispy on the outside and moist and perfect on the inside.  The curry was awesome. Some random thoughts:  The seating was a bit weird.  The tables seated four people, but they're set up in a way that two separate couples could sit there together, but in order to do so you'd have to awkwardly (or sauvely) ask if you can join them at their table.

Let's break it down: Falafel balls: 4/5 Though I like to bite in to a falafel ball and see green, I was absolutely not disappointed with the more yellow color of this one. Very tasty and not over salty. I prefer a little more fresh herbs and a little more crunch. Pita: 1/5 Plain old thin white pita. Not very flavorful, not fluffy, not my thing. Toppings: 3/5 Mostly tasty but very standard tasting. Nothing outstanding. Love pickles of course but the cabbage slaw was sort of flat. Tahini sauce: 4.5/5 Delicious. This is what you want when you get tahini sauce. In conclusion, definitely a good and tasty cheap snack ($3) but definitely not the best falafel sandwich I've ever had.",7,7,6,8

Whenever friends and family came to visit me in New York...first things first...Ippudo! If  you go at a normal time for lunch/dinner, you have to wait forever for a table. And on weekends...literally FOREVER. Not sure if this is a pro/con but you might also have to share a table. For me this was a pro since I met new friends who recommended me to other fabulous ramen joints. Of course none compared to Ippudo! When people generally think of ramen they think of those dried packaged noodles but there are people making fresh noodles at Ippudo. The noodles at Ippudo are what get me! The appetizers are all fantastic! Really, never had a bad experience here. YUM!",7,9,6,8
442,9974,364,12/13/11,"The food here is surprisingly good and very reasonably priced- I came here for a birthday party and also liked that they split everyone's drinks and orders on separate tabs. Most places hate doing that, but it's so practical when there are people who get there early or late, so I give them kudos for having good old fashioned common sense.  The space is also good, but if you are looking to host a huge party, it might not be big or organized enough. Our dinner party awkwardly waited for dinner, with half our party sitting down and the other half standing and waiting for the table next to them to finish. I also thought the music was super loud for dinner, although the actual music was fun. All in all, a solid place- they also have amazing happy hour specials and I will definitely be back for that!",7,4,8,5

I appreciate that these guys are trying to bring the San Francisco burrito to New York. Now, call me a snob (go ahead, do it), but these burritos just aren't as good as San Francisco burritos.  Authentic burritos are not made (incredibly slowly) by hipsters.  That said, authentic burritos are also made in much dirtier kitchens with much more questionable ingredients. Overall, I like this place.  It's convenient and tasty; it's just not as good as it's hyped up to be.",6,2,5,1

Tasty thin crust pizza and locally brewed beer on the menu...what more could you want in a pizzeria? As the other reviews mention, this is definitely a no-frills, crowded restaurant, but that's part of the experience. Cop a feel on the brick wall as you're waiting in line for the restroom to get a sense of the heat that is generated to bake those excellent pies... There's something about pizza crust in New York that just can't be duplicated here in the Bay Area...a buddy of mine says it's the water.

This resturaunt offers reservation blocks for this monstrous helping of tender, juicy pork that is covered in crispy skin that is then sauted in its own juices. Sides include rice, toppings, lettuce leaves for wraps and a few side dishes. Momofuku didn't take reservations for a regular dinner but did take reservations for the pork shoulder meal they offer about once every hour.

448,28219,863,10/28/14,"We had a great dinner here for my friends birthday. We were a huge group of 17 people and the staff nailed the service, food delivery, and drink refills. She could not have chosen a better place to have a large group for a birthday dinner. I wish I could remember our two servers names because they were really great! He made sure we were all filled up before happy hour ended which was surprisingly until 8PM on a Friday night! We all had different plates and everyone seemed to enjoy everything they had. The only complaint I heard was from one of our friends who got the burger with loads of stuff on it. It kept falling apart so it was frustrating to eat but was delicious she said. We started with the ""cheese balls"", Burrata, which was a ball of mozz stuffed with fresh ricotta and served with fresh fruit (pears, peaches, apples), oil, and herbs. The cheese ball was a special and was really amazing - we definitely could have gotten a few of those as 3 was not enough. For our meals my friend who sat next to me and I shared a steak and spinach salad and one of the many special fish dishes. The fish, Australian Sea Bass, was in a wonderful white wine and capers sauce that I could stop dipipng even the steak from the salad in. I chose the sweet potatos, kumata, side dish and they were simple but delicious as well. The salad had homemade goat cheese in it and roasted strawberries - amazing combo. We added pecans to the salad and it really was the icing on the cake. Since we were still going out afterwards we skipped dessert but we still wanted to give our firend a song, so I went to see the waiter when no one was looking. They were already on top of it, and we didn't even need to ask to have something prepared for her. Our waiter told us it was in and should be out in a few mins. They brought our birthday girl a free dessert complete with candles and a song! It was a great evening and quite a surprise how well they handled our huge group. Well done, we will be back!",9,6,7,7
449,58591,863,1/6/13,"Yelp rarely steers me so wrong. After seeing the great reviews for this place, I came for dinner and left hungry and disappointed. As others have said it takes about 35 minutes to get your food. The waiter came and took our uncomplicated order of lamb lollies appetizer, fish tacos and crosti (with prosciutto and cheese). 5 minutes after our order was taken someone came by, who introduced herself as one of the owners, and asked what we ordered, wrote it down, and told us she would check on it. However, she warned that our order would take a while, since they ""make everything to order."" This explanation annoys me, if you have a slow kitchen, just say that. I don't think you're making me fresh bread for my crosti, or tortillas for my tacos. So what exactly is being ""made to order""? My food should be ready in about 10 minutes from a proficient restaurant kitchen, that preps properly for a busy dinner service on the weekend. Also, after one of the owners initially came by, no one else came to our table to tell us how much longer our food would take, I just saw employees looking at our table empty of food and head back to the kitchen. In general if someone from the restaurant tells me they are checking on my order, then provide an update. Otherwise, don't bother telling me you are checking. After we finally got our food, the disappointment continued. The order of fish tacos has lukewarm fish in a lukewarm soft taco shell. The whole bite was a bit bland but edible, and at that point, I was hungry enough to call it a win. The lamb lollies had too much rosemary and were a bit overcooked, but otherwise fine and came with tasty sides. However, the crosti was terrible, it was salty to the point of being inedible, and I tried to eat it, because I was so hungry. But I gave up after two bites. The same woman, one of the owners, checked on us after the food had been cleared off our table, and when I told her about the crosti, she took it off our bill. All in all though, I will definitely not be back.",3,7,1,8

Mid-way into finishing the hotpot, my friend bit into something crunchy and very sour, and it turned out to be a cockroach.  My friend, who ate half of the cockroach was traumatized, and she ran to the restroom to throw-up everything that she ate.  The waitress apologized, and the manager called me later that day to apologize, saying he will inform the owner of this incident, and the owner will call us to apologize.  It is Monday evening, and the owner hasn't called us.

Unfortunately when my food arrived, I was presented with a bill that was 25% higher than the prices on Yelp.  When I called to let them know they charged me too much, all I received was grief and a defense that I HAVE to pay the price they charged me.  After about 15 minutes of trying to simply explain that there prices are wrong, only being able to speak to incompetent people with a very poor command of English, and no manager or owner to speak to, I was finally asked to send the food back, so I did.  Are they serious?  For a $5 difference, they would rather lose the order and a customer.  Do these people care about their reputation?  There are great places to eat in Carroll Gardens that actually care about their customers and reputation.  So sorry Joya has a crappy, incompetent, staff. If what you are looking for is crap service, this is it.  I wish I would have had the opportunity to eat and review their food.  Maybe they would have received a much better review.",1,9,2,8
460,2523,292,1/15/12,"Cafe Condesa is one of those places I will think of fondly when I'm old and have left New York as the epitome of things that I loved while I lived here. My first experience with CC was around 2 years ago, on a first date on a blizzarding February night. I was cold, cranky, and wasn't really sure what to make of my date, but the warmth and coziness of the restaurant put me at ease. It's a small restaurant, with the feel of a wine cellar with red brick walls, a long wooden countertop and endless wine bottles adorning the walls. We didn't have reservations, but were able to comfortably have a glass of pinot noir at the countertop before our table was ready.  Phew, nerves even more relaxed. Better yet, the small table we were eventually seated at was great for a first date: small and intimate, great for conversation and for some hand on the knee grazing. The brie and honey appetizer we started off with could not be more perfect; who doesn't love sweet, gooey cheese on a cold night? At that point, they were serving butternut squash ravioli, so I had that as a dinner portion, and boy am I glad I did. It was melt in your mouth goodness in a light butter sauce. Perfection. The date chowed down on a steak, and we left to go find dessert elsewhere. Long story short, we both spent the night completely satisfied. I've been back there again on other nights, but that time really set the standard. Today, however, I made the trip over there for brunch, and am glad I did. On another cold, windy day, the warmth of the restaurant could not help but be appreciated. I sipped on a mimosa- exceptionally fresh with tasty pulp in the glass. I was tempted to try the muddled berry mimosa too, but will have to make it back for that. Their poblano eggs benedict were delicious with perfectly poached eggs covered in a tasty, yet mild poblano pepper sauce sitting on top of wheat toast. It came served with lightly roasted potatoes and a mixed green salad. That, topped with a tiny bit of their house hot sauce made for a fantastic brunch. This warm little restaurant with the big glass windows does a great job- of satisfying the pickiest of appetites and making you forget that it's freezing cold outside. Great times, great memories, I'll be glad to be back again and again.",9,6,8,4
461,9555,33,4/30/14,"I am giving 2 stars for this restaurant because the food/kitchen/dish was not cleaned and I suffered from diarrhea... So I came here with my girlfriend for lunch yesterday. It was crowded but the ambiance was nice. After being seated, we ordered the crispy shrimp salad and our waitress suggested us to order the mushroom pizza with egg which we did. Let's start off with the crispy shrimp salad, the shrimp has a little spice in it and was fresh, but the salad itself was pretty ordinary. The vinaigrette dressing you can find in any Japanese restaurant. It's also a bit pricey for a salad that has about 10 small crispy shrimps for the price of $25. Mushroom pizza with egg - this is definitely something special. They put an egg in the center of the pizza, so when you slice your pizza out, the egg yolk breaks and spread over your pizza. 1 star for this creative idea. But other than the egg, the pizza tasted just okay, I've had better pizza in other places like Adrienne's or TAPPO. I wanted to give a higher rating for this restaurant as the ambiance was nice and server was attentive, but the food/kitchen was obviously not clean and I suffered from diarrhea yesterday night.. After reading over the reviews, I found out someone wrote a review on this restaurant regarding food poisoning as well!! My girlfriend also had a bad stomachache yesterday, so it's really not just me.

The massaman curry is fabulous as well! The ambiance is warm and cozy with very quaint decor.

Summary: I felt like it was like going on a date with a REALLY popular person at school only to find out they have no personality.

I've been wanting to try it since it opened as it's a hop, skip and a jump from my crib and the whole locally sourced everything is definitely attractive. I made a rese for 3 people at 8:00 on a Thursday night and when we showed up a few minutes after we were seated right away. Everyone from the bartender to the hostess to the waitstaff are all so pleasant. My one girlfriend arrived before we did and ordered their take on a Manhattan, the Kenzie finish it which is McKenzie, bourbon, fresh lemon juice, cherry and a twist. It was very good but maybe just a touch too sweet for me.  We sat down and our waitress came right over. We ordered the bread to start, absolutely a must, and we were of course going to order a bottle of wine. I wasn't familiar with all of the local wines they were offering by the bottle so I asked the waitress to bring us a taste of 3, the Wolffer Estate Merlot, the Pythagoras meritage blend and a fabulous petit verdot. I loved the last one but my girlie's wanted the Merlot so that's what we went with. On to the food. Everything on the menu sounded so fabulous we couldn't decide. Here's a run down: 1. roasted vegetable bake goat cheese - I loved this but one of my girls thought the vegetables should have been cooked more, I like them crunchy. 2. roasted spaghetti squash with maple syrup and cinnamon - this was my least favorite dish as it didn't have much flavor. 3. roasted brussel sprouts with berkshire bacon - heaven on a plate. I could of eaten about 3 orders of this. 4. bone in goat cheese and herb stuffed chicken with red swiss chard, white wine and lardons - this seriously was one of the best chicken dishes I've had in a restaurant - ever. Juicy with crispy skin, perfectly cooked and the swiss chard was divine. 5. Lamb shank - this was a large portion with some sort of mashed potatoes or mashed vegetables that was good if just a teensy bit on the dry side. This still was a very good dish. I will definitely revisit again and again. This is such a great addition to our little hood and I'm sure they will be very successful. YAY!! I'm a fan!",8,9,7,7

The inside of Jean-Georges Vongerichten's ABC Kitchen is whimsical&hip. delicate&rustic.  country&urban.  cozy&breezy.  Sam Sifton of the NY Times describes it best when he says ""...the place is haute organic and Hamptons sustainable.... airy and open and relaxed the way the second homes of the wealthy often are..."" So true - It does feel like my [non-existent] vacation home. The space is best understood by going in person - beautiful lighting, a motley assembly of country chic furniture and pieces of grandma's chipped china thrown in for good measure - it all creates a mini cloud of luxury within the not so glamorous Flatiron/Union Square area.  Tapping the ABC Carpet & Home inventory, Kitchen uses sustainable, handcrafted pieces by local artisans as well as the indigenous Mapuche people of Patagonia.  The waitstaff, in their oh-so-cute plaid shirts, are perky and fresh faced... I swear, straight out of a Neutrogena commercial. As for the food...mmehhhh.  I shared a plate of Cured Meats and Local Cheeses ($17) with the table and then had a bowl of homemade yogurt with dates and granola.  Nothing was ""spectacular"" but certainly fresh in taste and well presented.  I attribute my lack luster reaction to poor ordering (bad M!) - their Housemade Ricotta Ravioli ($22) and the Spinach, Goat Cheese and Herb Pizza ($14) both look/smell incredible!  Their coffee, I must note, was outstanding and came in amazing pieces of pottery that practically molded into your hand.  Given the quality of the ingredients, prices were quite reasonable.

The bread service was delicious with the 3 dipping sauces. We 1st shared the fluke crudo. This was the only downfall of the dinner. The food was just mediocre here. I mean the fish was okay; it was just plain forgettable. You definitely need that orange and salt to brighten up the fluke. We ordered the Spaghetti and Duck Foie Gras Ravioli. We asked if we can create two portions of each so we each have 1/2 of the plates. However, the waiter kindly indicated that the kitchen doesn't do that. It's fine. THe spaghetti came in a cool dish with a glass cover on top to help finish the cooking. It was cooked to an al dente perfection. You can tell the spaghetti was freshly made because of its imperfections on the feel. It wasn't too tubular. The sauce was delicate and the basil leaves helped raise the dish to another level. It was simplicity at a perfection. The duck and foie gras ravioli was pillowy goodness. One delicate pressure made the raviloi explode in your mouth. It was salty goodness. Again the pasta was cooked to perfection. Honestly, the main dishes (meat & seafood) looked spectacular too. We saw a table of 4 next to us ordering dishes and they all looked beautifully appetizing.

Seems a shame that they are not open all year round.,8,5,7,6
480,100176,497,5/1/13,"A pathetically bad excuse for a restaurant.  Extremely cramped, no less...which makes it impossible to relax and enjoy a meal.  What they brought out was not edible...a fish wrapped in a piece of paper that didn't even look cooked.  The lamb shank looked like it was microwaved.  I would have probably felt better after an armed stickup in this pretty seedy neighborhood.  I actually went here based on the reviews from this site.  You've gotta wonder who is writing the reviews for this place",1,8,2,9
481,62095,548,8/13/13,Really good. This place has an upstairs that is less busy and you even get your own dining room. The food is pretty good! Stay away from the fish stew unless you're looking for something really light and unflavored.,7,5,8,6
482,32147,537,11/25/14,"SO disappointing!   This was my second visit.  The first, though not memorable, was nice enough, and since it was in a convenient location for out of town guests, I thought a return visit would be  fine; I honestly regret the choice! First of all, the service was poor.  I had to take my father's coat at the table and seek out someone to check it.  Our table was repeatedly interrupted mid-sentence for inane questions/comments from waitstaff.  Two  of our dishes were served to the wrong person at the table, which is unimpressive at a five-top.   In terms of the table, we were seated two on one side, three on the other.  I couldn't hear or see one member of my party because of the table setup.  The music was so loud that it inhibited conversation considerably-and I'm young (and love the velvet underground and the clash!).  I don't know how the older members of the group managed at all.  When we left, I heard that someone had asked that it be turned down a little; it was not. Secondly, the food was not up to standards for a restaurant of this type.  I've been to other Colicchio restaurants, and there was clearly something wrong here in comparison.  My baked ricotta was nicely flavored but inedibly hot, which left me way behind everyone and slowing down the pace of our meal.  It was served with nothing to spread it on and also no spoon.  An embarrassing amount ended up on the table since  it was too flaky to be eaten with a fork.  My biggest disappointment, though, was the quinoa ""risotto.""  I was excited to try this hybrid of two of my favorite carby indulgences.  Instead of the creamy dish I anticipated, I got a wet plate of one-note quinoa, like the last helping of a grain salad with too much dressing, or a bowl of brothy grain.  I left lots on my plate, but no server asked if I was satisfied.  Obviously, I skipped dessert--why waste the money or calories?  People at my table enjoyed the pumpkin panna cotta, which they said was excellent, while I suffered through bitter and weak coffee. Tom, I expected better!  I won't be back.",1,9,1,9
483,4750,490,2/23/10,"monday lunch, 12:30 pm, with mother let's just say that i wasn't impressed; dont get me wrong, some dishes were delicious, but decent service plus some mediocre dishes does not equal phenomonal. my mother and i went with the lunch tasting menu and we decided to try as many dishes as possible. butternut squash amuse - a little bit on the sweet side but the pine nuts were a perfect addition porcini flan - i was saddened a bit that i couldnt taste more of the crab texture tuna sashimi - the sashimi was super fresh and melted in my mouth black cod - personally not a huge fan of the gelatinous texture, judge for youself spanish mackerel - it was overcooked but the flavors were delicious duckling - i wouldve liked the skin to be crispier but my favorite flavor here was the ginger strip loin - cooked perfectly and made me long for more of the baby brussels sprouts coconut palate cleanser - loved every flavor in this and like it's supposed to, cleaned my palate clean in prep for dessert mango and passion fruit - the coffee ice cream balanced the fruit flavors of this dish well.  the coffee ic cream was definitely my favorite part chocolate souffle - the vanilla ic cream was the favorite amongst maple and chocolate.  the souffle pretty much went untouched. the food overall was good, but i would've liked more variety in texture. service - i honestly expected a lot more.  our food would be set in front of us then the food runner would walk away.. so we would wait a couple minutes for someone else to come and explain each dish.  and even though the restaurant wasn't packed, they rushed through the descriptions and rushed off without staying to see if we had any questions, which i found fairly rude.  overall, i just thought they were a bit stuck up. the restaurant itself is beautiful and the tasting lasted 2.5 hours.  it was a great place for lunch with my mother. BUT from bouley, i expected a lot more, i thought we'd be wow'ed; we werent.  also, our $5 cups of coffees were not fresh. would i go back - not worth my cash",7,2,6,3
484,85340,468,11/9/14,"You know Joe's hasn't lost its original flavor when it continues to keep its Chinese patrons even as the tourists and non-local New Yorkers come a-flockin'. Tip on how to eat the soup dumplings: I like to take a small nip (I'd advise against big bites as you'll likely burn your tongue) and pour the soup into a bowl of rice, eating the dumplings with the soaked rice. Turns it into a small meal than just appetizers. If you come in small numbers, you will likely be seated at a larger table with other patrons. In my case, I asked for a table for one in English, which meant I was shepherded to a non-Chinese table. (Other tables seated only Chinese customers.) Having been accustomed to the communal nature of Asian food culture, I did not mind this, and even enjoyed listening in on surrounding conversations, one of which was between two producers of a forthcoming NBC TV show in February. Don't anticipate anything even close to what you know as decent customer service here. The place is loud and busy and waiters are usually short with their customers -- one man at my table ordered a coke to a scowling waiter, as if he couldn't be bothered. The entire table had a good laugh over it. Just think of it as a concentrated experience of Chinatown's particular ""charm"" -- nothing is meant as a personal jab.

Granted, I only ever eat the meat options, maybe the vegetarian food is great - but If you want a place that can capably cook bacon, steak, or a burger, this isn't it.  (Maybe the shrimp is to die for?) Not-very remarkable food wouldn't be a problem if the menu wasn't ambitious and overpriced , but it is. And yet, all evidence seems to suggest that people like the place. It's like there's a collective illusion -  with such a cool interior, and hip crowds, and high priced menus,  the food must be  good, even if it doesn't, you know, taste good. Of course that doesn't stop me from going back every now and then to see if I've missed something. But so far I've only ever been. disappointed. Am I the only one?",3,2,1,5
487,10920,616,8/7/12,"Restaurant Week Lunch Review: With the exception of the very sweet hostess and the grandness of the decor, this place is stuffier than my nose when I have a cold.  (Sorry if that was too vivid). I realize I'm in a very small minority, but I don't care that it's RW -- I judge the same as I would any other time.  I'd rather a server that shows the slightest bit of emotion -- a slight smile, maybe? -- than one who knows which side of the table to serve from. I started with the Insalata.  Tiny and nothing special.  My friend had the Terine, which he said was just okay. For my meal, I had the Pollo.  Pretty sure they just killed the chicken, cut it up into three miniscule pieces and put it on a plate to be served.  It was so pink and chewy that I was almost positive I was eating a rubber band.  I realize in Europe they do undercook their meats a little more than they do here, but I have been to Europe, and I think most Europeans would question this.  Maybe I should have said something, but the server was scarce and unconcerned with our table. I also tried my friend's Tagliatelle.  The pesto wasn't flavorful and I've had much better homemade pasta elsewhere. The desserts were the saving grace and the only reason Ai Fiori gets two stars instead of one.  Both were decadent without being too overwhelming that I couldn't finish.  An absolute home run. I will take full responsibility for choosing a restaurant that isn't exactly ""my people"", but that does not excuse the service or rare chicken.",3,2,2,4

No.  But definitely among the top-ranked in my personal armada!  I ordered the Lamb Saag and Chicken Korma entrees.  The lamb was tender, the saag just right, a little spice (enough to make me get warm and sweat just a bit), but matched the flavors perfectly.  The portion looked really small when I opened the bag...but I was more than full when I was done. Same with the korma.  The chicken was a bit on the dryer side, but still flaked nicely, and the sauce was creamy and hit the spot! I will definitely be back for more!",8,7,7,6

494,1361,377,1/10/14,"The meal was worth being surrounded by the awful people. Did 2 person standby, was told an hour, I called at 45 min and it had been given up. Having them call me would be nice but it's a lot of work and phone-time being eaten up, it doesn't need to happen. They gave us a ~15min approximation, we showed up and waited like 3 min. We had a lovely time waiting at Tortilla Flats. There's not a ton of space in the waiting area/bar and the walkway to coat check, bathroom, hostess stand and main entrance all overlap. You will jostle during busy times. Service is super friendly and casual. There's a huge wine list and some good options by the glass. Cocktail program is a little dated, but well executed. Portions run medium to large. Servers talk about portions in American standards, not Italian. You can totally hobble the full anti/primo/secondo/contorno/cheese/dolce spread if you're in the mood, but you'll want to pace very slowly. Piatti unici are a small meal on their own. Food is super salty, even for NY's palate. I'm not mad. Roast chicken lives up the hype, super thin/crispy skin. Gnocchi is small, dense and has a little chew, more smart-foam pillow than down.  Pastas are across the board good. They had delicious unadorned raw/un-pasteurized cheeses. There aren't many surprises on the menu, straightforward and prepared well. First yelp review I read was mostly upset about there being no ketchup for the patate. That's ridiculous. Clearly it needed bolognese. (it needed nothing, maybe a little less salt, but it's some exemplary potatoes)",7,7,6,5

There are just too many liquor licenses in New York to make a weekend dinner friendly on anyone's wallet. The atmosphere is nice.  I meant to check out what the back of the restaurant was like, but I forgot.  The front was pleasant enough.  We ordered: - Scallop appetizer - delicious.  May have been my favorite dish of the evening. - Lamb sausages?  I can't really remember what they were called.  I thought they were fine. - Garganelli pasta - yummy. - Pork shoulder cannelloni - was delicious, but could have been a little larger i think... but maybe i should stop wanting food in such large portions. I mentioned to my girlfriends that I'd like to go here as a larger group sometime, but just read about the $20 corkage fee for the second (and third and fourth...ho ho ho) bottle of wine.  Ah well.

I felt it should've been a go to food to savor, and the waffle that came with it was pretty limp and soggy. The biscuit tasted dry and stale, much like they have been sitting around for a while. The chicken fried steak was surprisingly better, probably cause it was smothered in gravy. The sides really took the cake as far as the dinner went, mac and cheese was good, grits were good, and mash potatoes were good, but the hush puppies were extremely salty, almost unenjoyable. My group ordered 3 pie slices. The key lime was ok, nothing to rave about. The bourbon pecan pie was really good, and they make sure you taste that bourbon. The sour cherry pie was really good as well. Most remembered pieces at this spot were pecan and cherry pie, mac and cheese, and chicken fried steak.

It was partly upscale partly casual.  A nice balance.  Those of you familiar  with Five Napkin Burger (one of my favorite burger joints) I would say this place is similar but probably nicer.   The menu is great.  So many delicious things to choose from.  I liked the mix drink menu, but I wasn't in the mood for a hard drink so I stuck to wine.   It was tough deciding what to order but here it is: Roasted Tomato Soup with mini grilled goat cheese sandwiches Tuna Tartare B and B Classic Burger Everything was great!

They use an iPad to set up your reservation and call/text you when they have a table ready.  It was pretty efficient - our group just shared snacks in other LES places like Katz  until they called us. I came with 3 other friends, so I was able to try a bunch of different meatballs.  We ordered the bolognese meatballs with parmesan sauce, spicy pork meatballs with the meat sauce, chicken meatballs with tomato sauce, and the beef meatballs with mushroom sauce.  Every one of these meatballs was delicious!  Though, a clear favorite would be the spicy pork meatballs with the meat sauce.  Did I taste sriracha in that meatball? Don't forget to order the ice cream sandwiches.  I got a chocolate chip, vanilla ice cream sandwich.  The cookie was a little overdone and it was perfect with the ice cream because it added this crispy texture to it.  It was to die for. The shop is small with a wine bar & bar seating and a long table in the middle.  I actually liked the long table - it's kind of cool that we are sitting next to complete strangers eating and enjoying meatballs.

Potato salad, baked beans, and the mac and cheese were all fantastic. Great booze options, including a strong beer list and an even stronger bourbon/whiskey list. Lastly, great staff/ownership.

The mojitos come adorned with a sugar cane stick, which would make any 20-something-year old kid happy.  I had the salmon and the boyfriend had another fish dish (I forget which one--sea bass sounds right), and both were incredible.

I haven't been here in a long time (i mean 5+ years) but from what i remember not much has changed. So what did we order?  A Pizza of course!  It came out - piping hot and crispy...after a nearly 40 minute wait after ordering at late lunch...so no line (something like 2:30 pm on a friday) The restaurant was moderately busy, but nothing like it's normal customers.  With empty tables a plenty and as much experience as the restaurant has, they should be able to pump out pizzas a little faster than 40 minutes or so.   Anyway - so what kind of pizza did we order?  A Pizza w/onions, peppers and sausage.  Nothing too crazy - but not plain.  So what did we get?  A brick oven pizza, cooked very well, a good amount of cheese, but sporadically placed so some sections had very little cheese.  The onions and peppers were tossed about in a good organization as well as the meat.  All the toppings were evenly placed except for the cheese. As for the flavor - the flavor of everything was good - although, the thing crust by the center was a little too thin as the sauce and everything in the middle sogged down and some toppings slipped off the pizza.  That had to be salvaged with fingers back onto the pizza. Overall - is it a good slice?  Very much so.  Best in New York - not so sure, but definitely a good slice.  Worth the money though?  I don't think so.   TL;DR - Tasty pizza, not worth the money though.",6,4,4,6

508,3148,482,12/16/09,"I came upon Hearth in my search for a place for my mother's birthday that would be able to accommodate my brother's gluten intolerance. I called ahead of time to make sure they were prepared for such diners. Once I arrived, (45 minutes before we sat down), I asked the hostess to make sure there would be a list of acceptable menu items for my brother's perusal. Despite these precautions, our waitress had not been informed of his needs and just handed him the full menu without any indications of problematic ingredients. She was happy to check with kitchen, but I'm going to take one star off because they sort of dropped the ball. It worked out in the end, but my brother was clearly very uncomfortable initially, and that could have been easily avoided. I also felt like they ruined a perfectly nice looking restaurant with all the red fabric squares mounted on the wall. The layout of the dining room here is strange to begin with, and they haven't done themselves any favors with that hideous back wall. Other than those two minor issues, Hearth is a hit. My dad and mom had spent the afternoon at a wine tasting class at New York Vintners, so Dad was quite happy to chat up the bartender and sommelier for recommendations to go with our meal. I'm not too knowledgeable on the subject, but Hearth seems to have an excellent wine list. When we arrived, the sommelier was busy sampling all the new selections that had arrived over the weekend, and he told us that there are always new wines to try. So, if you're into wine, definitely keep Hearth in mind. As for the food, there were so many things on the menu that I wanted to eat. As I was out with the family, I tried to get everyone to order something that I wanted to try, and I came pretty close to succeeding! Sadly, I wasn't able to sample their slow poached duck egg and confit leg with frisee, shallots and brioche, or their grilled calamari, but I will simply have to go back. On this occasion, I opted to get their $35 three course cucina povera. The winter menu consists of ribollita, rabbit, and a salted butterscotch budino. They also started us all off with a lovely shooter of pea soup. If this is what they are calling ""humble cooking,"" let me tell you, I'd eat like an Italian peasant any day of the year. Ribollita, a thick, hearty stew made of bread, leafy greens and white beans, was one of my favorite dishes when I was in Florence. Hearth served theirs topped with large parmesan shavings and crispy buttery croutons. The taste was the same, but the texture was even better. The rabbit came with polenta and olives, and was very nice. I normally hate olives, but these had been cooked, so their potent flavor was less overpowering, and I was able to properly enjoy their briny earthiness. I did wish there was a little bit more polenta, as the rabbit and the olives were piled on top of it, so it got a bit lost with all the meat and sauce and juice. The budino was a serviceable pudding. Not especially remarkable, but a satisfyingly sweet ending to a delicious meal. Boyfriend and I did a bit of a juggling act with our orders, as I agreed to share my rabbit, if he agreed to get the veal ricotta meatballs. They were really really good. Can't complain too much about a giant, wonderfully seasoned, cheesey meatball with a generous heap of tomato sauce and tender ravioli. Mmm. He also started off with the plate of house-made charcuterie, which featured a duck pate, rabbit ballotine, pickled veggies, and mustard, as far as I can recall. If I'm forgetting a component, I still remember that this was excellent. He finished off with some fantastic apple cider donuts with maple ice cream. These were so crispy and had a wonderful cinnamon flavor. Very delicious. I also tried Mom's paper wrapped cartoccio escolar, which was incredibly moist and buttery. I'd heard great things about escolar, and about cooking food encased in paper, and this dish was a great introduction to both. My dad's initial skepticism almost scared my mom off from ordering it, but after one bite he was forced to admit that it was better than the fish dish that he ordered-- not that he offered to share it with anyone else. My parents also split a side of the chef's famed gnocchi, which were meltingly good, and almost mashed potato-like in their creamy goodness. My brother got the roasted duck breast with turnips and concord grapes. I blinked and he inhaled the turnips so that he could concentrate on the duck, but I tried the rest and it was great. You can't go wrong with duck, and this one had crispy skin and was cooked medium rare. Concord grapes have a very strong and distinct flavor, but they actually complemented the duck here. Very nice. The brother was very very happy. He also had a side of polenta, and we some how wound up with a side of sweet potatoes. These were good, but probably the least inspired of the offerings we sampled. Bottom-line: for lots of great Italian food, try Hearth! Just shy of 5 stars.",9,8,8,8

We got there early which was a good thing as it got busy. First of all the bench seating on the 2nd floor does not match the table height, the benches are way too high or tables way too low which ever way you want to look at it! It made it super super uncomfortable trying to have lunch. They seemed to put a lot of money into the place yet they couldn't measure the benches properly????

We started with a complimentary amuse bouche of warm potato soup with a truffle foam- I wish I could have gotten a giant bowl for an appetizer; it was so well done.  The bread was fine/meh- nothing to write home about (this is an issue for me- you know how I feel about bread baskets- I want to be wowed).  But the food we ordered was really enjoyable.  Fried calamari to start with a yuzu dipping sauce and I thought the unique shape of the calamari was an interesting touch.  I got the butter poached lobster over potato ravioli and spinach.  Lobster was cooked great, potato ravioli lacked a bit of flavor I thought.  My boyfriend got the beef short rib which was cooked to perfection- I'd HIGHLY recommend this dish.  For dessert we got pumpkin tiramisu, also good.   It was such a beautiful restaurant, with really attentive service.

More than once I've picked up a slice only for it to immediately droop flaccidly, like a flower held by a sad clown, sending the sausage chunks toppling off like CGI commuters on a suspension bridge in a disaster movie. Other than that, it is very good pizza, sure, but I never quite understood why people rave about it like they're in an infomercial and the announcer just said ""Tired of this?"" and then they show other pizzas exploding, spilling everywhere, just barely beating out your kid for Valedictorian, etc. In the end, I enjoy Lombardi's pizza just as much as I enjoy all other above-average pizza--that is to say, a lot--no more, no less.",6,5,6,5

We got the family style dinner, even though the description of it was somewhat mysterious. The waitress did warn us that it was going to be a lot of food, but we were surprised by just how much food there was! I think we must have gone through the whole menu! They wrapped up the majority of the last two dinner courses for us, and we have fairly big appetites! Every bite was delicious, and the staff was extremely attentive. The ingredients of each dish were described with story like detail, and everything was very fresh. I really appreciate the respect they give to each ingredients, particularly the reverence and respect for the meats. After the family supper, we did order the chocolate mousse with elderflower and raspberries to share.

519,7411,231,10/23/12,"The pizza alone would earn 4 or 5 stars. 5 for the crisp one. 4 for the soggy one. I've never been to Naples, but I'm told (and believe) that Sottocasa generally does justice to the original. The stars decline a bit for value and no reasonable way to augment the dining experience without having to make a second stop at an ATM. They use top ingredients, so I get that the pies are going to be expensive. Most are in the $16 to $20 range. Each pie is cut into 4 slices. The whole pie appears to be the equivalent of less than 2 slices of 'regular' NY pizza (Thank you to Mr. Berger; my 10th grade geometry teacher) which means that for an average eater, a half pie may not do it. (and to those of you food snobs who are so offended by me daring to compare original Neapolitan pizza to lowly NY pizzeria slices...bite me).   So, I'm OK with the $16 pie...even if it's a $16 pie for each person...it's good stuff. But beyond that, the prices remain stratospheric. I like beer with my pizza (again, the snobs can bite me) and there's one beer on the menu that's $5 or so. The rest are as much as some of the pies. I didn't check the prices, but they seemed to have a nice selection of wine...and I'll bet that the price structure is similar. All that means that If I wanted to come here and really enjoy a meal of a pie and a couple of drinks (and not limit myself due to pricing), I'd have to spend $40 to $60 with tax and tip...and that's a bit high for pizza and beer. Even really good pizza and good beer.   Besides pricing, the hours are OK. The crowd is fine but as one reviewer noted, the place gets kinda Chuck E Cheeseish at dinner time.

I'll qualify this review by saying that all I had at Kefi was the souvlaki, but judging a Greek place in New York by it's souvlaki is like judging a Thai place in the city by it's pad Thai, or an Italian place by it's marinara. Souvlaki is a staple. And, by most accounts, one that's pretty hard to screw up: pita, meat, vegetables, tzatziki. It's Greek street food. Pretty simple. While Kefi didn't exactly screw it up, it was definitely not a sandwich I would seek out again. The meat was bland, the tzatziki was nowhere near plentiful enough, and the lettuce and tomatoes were oily and wilted. For the price, which was definitely not in the ""street food"" range, it was not great. To Kefi's credit, they did seat my friend and me without a reservation at 7:30 within seconds of us walking in (although we did get an awkward table behind a door in the back of the basement, but still, the restaurant was pretty crowded), the staff was highly attentive, and the whole place smelled amazing.

They served the regular menu. The service The host and hostess were nice greeting us which made us feel very welcoming. The bus boys were quick to fill water and provide necessary service. Our waitress, however, must have been tired and worked too much that night. She didn't smile when greeting us, she didn't make any facial expression when recommending dishes and wines. There is nothing on her. Sometimes I got excited what the servers are excited about their food, you know. But I'll leave it at that. The ambiance I love the rustic osteria style. That's exactly the environment where I wanna be in for a down home Italian meal. We are planning a honeymoon to Italy and I am hoping that's what we will get and more. However, being a hot spot in town, that's the original sin - it's very super incredibly loud. We got seated at a corner table where we could see the action of the kitchen so I guess, I'll let it pass. The food This is where Osteria Morini deserves a 5-star. And I think I am being fair to give it to them! We started out with the battilardo di affettati of 3 selections - prosciutto, sopressata, and coppa. They were yummy and not too heavy. They also gave a generous amount for the meat and we had a good start of the meal. Moving on to antipasti, we chose the fegatini, which is the duck liver mouse layered with passito wine, with grilled crostini. It was delish! The wine flavor was lingering in the mousse and gave it a nice fragrance. The crostini was warm and fluffy and, I am a sucker for bread like that. To the pasta, we each ordered the tagliatelle and the spaghatti. Both were generous in ingredients, fresh and al dente in texture, va-va-voom in flavors. We didn't go on to the secondi, but we did get dessert and the coffee. The dessert was the coffee gelato and it was yummm. Michael White, you redeemed yourself. Sorry, we don't go back to Marea because your servers sucked and food was not that great. But we will keep coming back to Osteria Morini. p.s.

I'm a cole slaw fanatic, and their slaw was fresh and crunchy, not soupy.  The collards were spicy and sweet all at once, and the corn had cotija cheese magic all over it. We also shared two of the Elbow Room mac & cheese options--the Buffalo, and the Tingha.  The Buffalo won everyone's heart for sure, but the Tingha was really yummy too. I shared a pork link (nice snap to it) and pork ribs (fall-off-the-bone tender) with my husband, and though I could only eat a bit of each because of how rich it all was, it was totally top notch.  I had a bite of his brisket as well, and it was probably the best brisket I've ever had.  Full stop. The service was lovely, too, which was a delightful departure from the usual brusqueness I'm accustomed to as a Brooklynite.  The bartender entertained us with drinks and comfortable chat when the first two of us arrived.  Then, when #3 got there, they showed us to our table ...gasp... BEFORE our entire party arrived ... and it wasn't a problem or big deal to them.

534,94169,465,7/17/11,"This tourist trap has some ok pizza, but it's vastly overrated.  The crust is bland, the cheese is tasteless, the pepperoni is cut from the cheap pepperoni sticks, and the tomato sauce doesn't taste tomatoey--it tastes like a red, salty, pasty mess.   The combination is definitely edible, but only because each of the ingredients mysteriously masks the deficiencies of the others.  Salt and texture can go a long way to making something mediocre taste better than it is, in other words.  Add that to the line and cash-only and you're better off looking for an alternative.   Speaking of alternatives, let me recommend two:  1) Paulie Gee's (Greenpoint) and 2) Best Pizza (Williamsburg), both of which are relatively close to Grimaldi's, geographically.  The former serves Rome-inspired innovations which are absolutely delicious (may I recommend the Delboy, Monte Cristo, and Cherry Jones--though they're all amazing).  The latter is also definitely its own animal: Roman-like, but also serves thick-slice as well, both amazing.  But less known is that Best Pizza also serves probably the best meatball subs and chicken parms in the 5 boroughs (and I'm truly not kidding).

536,9579,140,7/8/14,"I had been wanting to go to Pok Pok, but never really wanted to deal with a wait. I finally got the chance on an early Sunday dinner. I had been to Whiskey Soda Lounge prior, but Pok Pok is the superior Ricker establishment. I really wanted to try the poussin, but they were out of it and a couple of other things by Sunday. So we settled on the minced pork laap, the pork belly/shoulder curry, and the chiang mai sausage. I skipped on Ike's wings this time because I had already tried them before, but man they are good. The minced pork salad blew my mind. It's not really a salad, but more of an explosion of flavor of spice. It is spicy, but not in the hot sauce kind of way. Paired extremely well with the sticky rice and cucumber. The curry was as equally amazing. The meat was tender, with the pork belly fat providing a lot of flavor. The curry tasted amazing with the sticky rice. I was going to shy away from ordering it because of the overabundance of pork belly in my diet, but I'm glad that I did not. On the other hand, the Chiang Mai sausage was a complete miss. The sausage, while solid, felt uninspired compared to the other dishes. It came with some other vegetables and pork rinds to dip in a chili paste. I also ordered a gin and tonic, which had quite an interesting flavor from the kaffir lime. It paired very nicely with the spices from the dishes; worth a try. Service was a bit slow, but the food came out fast. I think that value has a place in the discussion of Pok Pok. My SO felt that the prices were a bit steep considering that in Thailand (which my SO has been to), much of the food can be found in the dirt cheap places. While true, I think the dishes that amaze at Pok Pok can be hard to find in the US. Moreover, when I browsed through the recipes in the cookbook, I'm not even sure where I can find a lot of the ingredients (e.g. blood?!).

540,83983,414,6/20/11,"Amazeballs. Ever since my first frozen Stouffer's meal of Swedish meatballs and frequent trips to IKEA finished with a meal of Swedish meatballs, I've grown an obsession for those round little monsters drenched in gravy. And when I speak of meatballs, I speak of those not served with spaghetti and tomato sauce, rather I speak of those served yonder from the land of platinum blonds and yodelers. But sadly, I haven't came across any restaurant in San Fran that specializes in meatballs, let alone even serves a dish of specifically Swedish meatballs. And no I'm not going to count IKEA because I am merely speaking of a restaurant, as in I have to wait 40 minutes to be seated by a pretentious uppity hoot for some mediocre food that costs more than my last week's paycheck. Boo. But back to the story. I never found that meatball restaurant in San Fran, but thank the world for good ol' television. I came across The Meatball Shop during Andrew Zimmerman's NYC: Will Work for Food episode where he played the obnoxious creepy waiter at The Meatball Shop. Amidst his whacky antics, I was intrigued by the restaurant. Meatball Shop? I just knew this restaurant was what I was looking for... ALL. MY. LIFE. Now I would say that I flew 3,000 miles just to get my hands on these babies just to add to the dramatics of this story, but that is a lie. Fortunately Andrew Zimmerman aired that episode a couple weeks prior to my already booked trip to NYC, so I added the Meatball Shop to my list of things to visit while out in NYC. (Screw you Statue of Liberty, I'm here to get some balls!) And The Meatball Shop was just almost, yes almost, everything I dreamt of. Not IKEA? Check. One hour wait? Check. Pretentious hostess? Not really. $$$? Not really. Swedish Meatballs? Kinda. Meatballs? Check! Yeah, like I said, it was ALMOST everything I dreamt of. I ordered the classic beef with parmesan cream sauce on top of roasted vegetables. Ugh, can somebody please remind me to listen carefully when being overly excited? Despite the server announcing what the roasted vegetables were of the day all that registered in my meatball induced brain was ""blah blah blah. MEATBALLS! blah blah blah."" Gross, the roasted vegetables of the day were arugula and beets. Like really? That's the worst of all worst combos. Bitter arugula and [indescribable horrendous description] beets. I wanted to die. My meatballs were so delicious, but every bite of roasted vegetables made me regurgitate slightly a portion of my delightful meatballs. So I quit the roasted vegetables, but realized the meatballs were too salty without a side. *sigh. Don't you hate when there's some uncontrollable force that just ruins a perfection. Luckily the lover ordered mash potatoes for his side and weighs like negative 100 pounds so I had a backup to that beet disaster.

I've never been a huge fan of gnocchi, but this place does it well. I had the salmon as my main course and the fish was fresh and grilled lightly to greatness. The sauce, mushrooms and butternut squash complimented the dish beautifully. I really can't say much more but how great the food is- you would just have to try it for yourself. However, I can speak on behalf of the waitress that attended to our table and she was PERFECT. Of course many NYC restaurants nowadays provide you with a refillable water bottle on the table but only ONCE did I have to pick up the bottle and fill it for myself. The waitress still attended our drinks and met all our expectations. I can't wait to introduce this place to friends and family in the future.",9,9,8,7
549,42180,273,11/20/08,"Barrio Chino certainly deserves it location - I don't think a Mexican restaurant could get any more LES.  As I live in the neighborhood, I don't find anything wrong with that, and in fact a lot to like.  The crowd (and yes, it can get crowded) is young, attractive, and well-dressed, the margaritas hit the margarita spot, and the food is tasty throughout (the calamari tacos are my favorite). With the strong upsides come a couple downsides.  The wait can be fairly long, at least on the weekend (although that's to be expected); it's VERY cramped, going hand-in-hand with high decibel levels (again, expected); and most disappointingly, the portions are extremely small.  Not that the prices are that high, but I'd rather pay an extra %50 and get an extra %50 than have to buy two portions, because that's just embarrassing, even for a guy.  Maybe splitting appetizers is the way to go.",6,4,5,3

Its the sort of establishment that if you make 125k a year, you could come in regularly and just have a very consistent steady meal off a reasonably varied menu. The value play here is to come in here on a weekday lunch, sit at the bar, have a cocktail, start with the duck liver mousse that is served with house baked ciabatta crostinis (5 stars for this dish, though its rich, so you might need to share), and have whatever the special is for the day.  Occasionally go in for a treat and do the tasting menu. Very consistent kitchen, definitely better than your average lunch, but typically not blow your socks off, and just accessible enough to make it a regular spot.",6,2,5,4

Its debatable whether its worth $5 a slice, though the size and thickness make it enough to satisfy most appetites.",4,2,3,3
558,20712,211,4/10/13,"I absolutely adore artichoke. Artichoke on a pizza? Oh, this place will be the death of me. This location is conveniently located just above The High Line so we were able to take a nice walk down the park and hop downstairs right to Artichoke. Just like Michael C., their signature pizza is definitely not my cup of tea. For what it is, the pizza is pretty tasty. We asked if we could order by the slice. It's not of the norm during lunch time but our waitress said it wasn't busy (we were the only ones in the restaurant) so she said we could definitely order by the slice. Now that's customer service! We ordered 2 slices of the artichoke, 2 slices of the margherita. and an order of their garlic bread sticks. Artichoke -- Very unique and not like your typical NYC pizza. It's very soupy, with a mix of artichoke hearts. spinach, cream sauce, and cheeses. Their dough is a little thicker but it was cooked to perfection. The crush was crunchy but not overly hard. The toppings slipped right off as I took a bite, which drives my point of the toppings being soupy. I probably could've slurped everything up and finished it off with the crust at the end. Margherita -- A complete 180 compared to the artichoke. Loved the flavorful tomato sauce and toasted basil. There was a thin layer of cheese, which is what I prefer. Garlic bread sticks -- Heavily flavored with garlic with a simple, yet amazing dipping sauce. We couldn't even finish half since we had the pizza. It was so good we even packed it in our luggage to take back home. It came warm just out of the oven so the bread sticks were super soft. Delicious but you might want to think twice if you're going to go directly back to work after. Check that garlic breathe and either brush your teeth or rinse with mouthwash. Funny fact: Who's seen A Christmas Story? Well, I love that movie. Watched it every year as a child. I still watch it as an adult and enjoy every second of it. This location has the leg lamp!

When the next four top was seated we joked with them about our proximity. Started with Devils on Horseback and bruetta.  Both were good. Was a little surprised at the tiny cheese serving for the price, but impressed with the flavor with the beans. By the time our entrees arrived we were all sweating in our crowded booth.  We realized we were luckier than the poor table with their back close to the bar getting hit by everyone walking by and closer to the loud annoying guys sitting at the bar. The two guys in our party separately went to the unisex bathroom and were hard-pressed to decide if it was better than a Texas porta potty in August.  They said it was cleaner, but melt-your-face hot and amazingly small. Entrees were fine. Service was fine.  We had planned on dessert, but were ready to leave the uncomfortable hot table and sprinted to the door when the check was paid.

I called up in the afternoon seeing if I can reserve a table, but was told they do not take reservations.  Nick the manager said that if we were going to arrive before 7 there will be a short wait and he was right.  It wasn't until after 8 that the masses started showing up.  We were seated near the kitchen, but was separated by a semi-wall with windows.  Though we had a view of the semi-open kitchen, the windows were annoying because they swung out and I would bang my head when I leaned back.  Another thing that bothered me was that our table was near the bar and when it got crowded with people waiting for tables, I'd have people's butts next to me as I'm eating.  Personal space, people!  Overall the d√©cor was kind of an upscale Greek diner. Our group decided to order multiple dishes family style.  For appetizers, we had the fried calamari (decently seasoned), pikilia (assortment of spreads), grilled octopus (2 tentacles, which wasn't nearly enough) and a large greek salad.  The feta was creamier than any feta I've had before.  For entrees, there was lamb chops, ribeye steak, grilled swordfish, salmon & sardines (smelt), grilled chicken and the Kyclades mixed seafood special.  The special was a massive platter that included a filet of sole, stuffed shrimp, stuffed clams, scallops and a lobster tail.  All entrees were massive and came with sides, such as lemon potatoes, rice, fried potato disks & horta, which as was explained to me was sauteed leafy greens of the day.  Gawd that was a lot of food!  The standouts were the very tender ribeye and the swordfish, both of which disappeared fast as it was passed around the table.  The piece of swordfish we got was bigger than the ribeye!  Plus it was flaky and not tough at all, which is hard to find in a nice piece of swordfish.

It is not unusual to have a celebrity sighting at this cool hangout, which was even featured in the Lenny Kravitz ""Again"" video.

Due to the limited space, there is often a line stuck in the entrance way vestibule or spilling onto the street.

However, once I sampled the food, I was able to ignore the mess under my feet.  My Grilled Chicken and Corn Salad was a huge portion of mixed greens, expertly marinated chicken, sweet corn kernels, and tortilla strips.  The house dressing was tangy and mustardy.  It added a delicious seasoning to the dish.  My colleague's Cuban Style Roast Pork was tender and juicy.  Our side of Tostones were crisp and more moist than most; they were definitely the best I have ever tried.  Lastly, we topped off the meal with my first (and certainly not my last!) Michelada - a Corona blended with lime juice and Tabasco.  It was a tangy and refreshing treat. Cafe Habana serves up tasty, traditional Cuban food at affordable prices.

Wines are also cheaper during happy hour, but I'm a beer girl so I am not too sure about the prices on those.  Even when it's not happy hour, the draft beers are only $5.  Not a bad price for these parts. So what yummy treats, you might ask?  How about some delicious sliders with bacon in the beef, cooked to perfection right in front of you with some cheese and onions?  It gets yummier with the sauces including ketchup, chipotle ketchup, jalapeno and bbq.  Not to mention the fries.  Have them your way with cheese, or chili.  I've had them all, and they're all good.  In the mood for a shake?  Do it.  Maybe some pecan pie a la mode?  Yessssss. My only complaint is that the first two times we went there, my hubster asked for pickles both times, and never got them but was charged for them.  No biggie, because we haven't had an issue with this since.  Great service.",7,6,8,7
590,140330,764,5/8/12,"I had a groupon for his place worth $40 that I paid $20 for. And I'm soo glad I took the chance to try something different and go to this restaurant. It was my first time trying this kind of food. I decided to take two girlfriends with me and they loved it just as much as I did. The atomosphere is dim cozy and relaxed. Service was excellent. We had atleast 3-4 people serving us. The chef and owner personally came out to check on us...very sweet guys. So, for appetizers we ordered the cheese plate and the mouth watering chicken spring rolls. Soo delicious and what a great start. Lol we asked for one extra piece of bread to eat with the cheese for my friend and they brought out a whole bunch of extra bread without extra charge. For drinks, my two friends got two BIG cranberry and vodka. Then, as our meal we ordered and split it all together. That way we all got to try everything. We ordred the LE POULET ROTI AU JUS (chicken), Mushroom Risotto, and Filet Mignon. The food was so good, we just started eating and didnt bother talking for a couple minutes lol. It was finger licking good. The chicken was so unique and had such an amazing flavor to it. It came with mashed potatoes, haricot vert and baby carrots. We all loved this so much and it was an excellent choice. The Filet Mignon was def the most tender steak I've ever had in my life....it came with asparagus,potatoes, mushrooms. I love mushrooms and asparagus. Yummy! Also I loved the sauce it was in. Lastly, the Mushroom Risotto was so rich and creamy we couldnt stop eating it. Wow! We were already talking about coming back as we were finshing up our food. We ate it all! Lol no leftovers or a piece of anything left lol. Surprisingly, everything we ordered was a good proportion..usually restaurants like this barely give you anything to leave and you end up leaving hungry. We were delightfully pleased after our experience there. We couldnt stop talking about it lol. Im so glad my friends loved it soo much! It started out night off so nicely before a night out in the city. The total bill came to 70-something. The three of us paid $30 each for all that food..totally worth it and what a good deal! We will definetly come here again...next time I will try the salmon and maybe have some dessert too :) And I would totally bring a date here",8,7,7,6

Both were just delicious! Then we topped it off with a couple mimosas which you can't go wrong with.

593,105300,528,8/26/12,"Before headed to New York, my goal was to get a lobster roll and I succeeded. Weirdly enough, when I went to Luke's Lobster, I enjoyed the crab roll much more than the lobster. The crab was so sweet! The reviews on here say it was either over dressed or bland but I guess I was lucky because it was none of those things when I got it. It might have been because it was crab season. The shrimp roll was just ok. I ordered the Taste of Maine and also had some chowder. Overall, it was a good experience. They luckily had one table enough to fit my party of five. The rolls were great on a buttery piece of toast. The chowder was a nice consistency and taste. The people I was traveling with didn't enjoy it as much as me but it didn't have to do with the quality of Luke's more so than that they were tried of their travels and ready to get back home (unlike me). I think they were also surprised at the high price for pretty small portions. Not sure if I'd come back if I had a limited time in NYC but if I did, I'd just get the lobster or crab roll.",7,3,6,4

595,20374,243,3/7/12,"In love with this place - been there twice in less than 2 weeks since there were so many things on the menu that I couldn't decide. Tried: Guanciale with egg (red sauce fresh mozzarella & guanciale with an egg) Cheese Christ - 3 cheese with black pepper Specken Wolf - Speck  & Mushrooms Romaine salad with candied walnuts & mint ALL of it was wonderful - the crust of the pizza is chewy and a little bit on the sweet side (in a good way) with a good amount of char but not too much so that you feel like you are immediately getting cancer eating it. The toppings are all super high quality and not over done, so you really taste everything. I have no problem giving a 5 star review without trying everything on the menu because I am confident that it is ALL GREAT. I need to absolutely rave about the ""Cheeses Christ"" - first of all, I like the name, it makes me laugh. Secondly, it is such a great balance of richness with out going over the top. The black pepper is the perfect seasoning bite to the smooth creaminess of the mixed cheeses. Yes, the wait is long. But, the space is cool and cozy (even though it's quite large) and can not wait to hang out in the back yard area when its balmy and I don't care how long I wait if I have a drink in hand and can be outdoors. It's also completely worth the wait so just hang out and relax cause sooner or later you will get your seat and be sooo happy.",9,9,8,8

We ate at so many fancy places, that they all started to taste the same. Except for our final meal at the The Grocery--which was clean, distinctive, and inventive.   As I said to the hubster, The Grocery's particular pleasure lies in the way that they use a California cooking model--putting fresh ingredients before fancy cooking.",7,4,8,6

Overall amazing burgers with good buns lettuce tomato and pickles and a old price . Runs about 9$ a person. One thing I noticed is they must have all this food ready constantly growing and flying out because the food came about 60 seconds after we ordered it which was incredible and amazing very good for a small cramped place busy people in and out quickly period that is one of the best things I can say about that by someone with was very good prices were very low.

The same can be said of the black pasta with seafood. My dinning companion also complained about the amount of sands present in the shell fish.   On the other hand, the famed spaghetti with tomato and basil is an exemplary case of ""less is more.""  The secret lies in the fine quality of the pasta and the use of butter in the sauce (saw it on FoodTV).  Definitely over-priced, I would still order it again.   The table breads with the accompanying dips and spreads are only eclipsed by Le Bernadin's salmon rillettes, and the polenta is pleasant.   Unfortunately, the lardo-wrapped halibut was unfathomably dry despite its inspiration.  A complete misfire.

I actually read the reviews after dinner and was wondering if they were as bland as my experience. I'll start with the good:  the drinks were decent.  whether alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks (i had something with ginger) i'd have to say they were good.  We dined in the back outdoor area it was a great day and didnt want to sit indoors so that's a plus.  the lamb breast  was only decent and that's where my train stops.  The nachos were just ok, felt like it was missing something....and where are the rest of the nachos?  felt like a kids meal.  same for the shishito, just ok nothing to write home about. I decided i would also try the chicken and waffles.  big mistake.  the waffles were fried, i think, and the chicken was super dry.   the proportions were pretty weird:  two small waffle pieces and hilariously large portions of chicken.  the waffles tasted like fried mulch.  as hungry as i was i couldnt eat the waffles.  they were terrible. lastly, the mashed potatoes....ah the mashed potatoes.  those were edible but still  pretty bad.

After 10 years in NYC I had given up all hope of finding a solid seafood spot that perfectly nails southern cooking with a new yorkers foodie twist. Food: -The crawfish are to die for, regardless of the season. The owners must have the best hookup in the states, always fresh, perfectly sized, juicy, and cooked to perfection. -The Sauce: You cant go wrong, but I do have a favorite. Old bay dry... with a side of the boil special in medium. The boil special adds this perfect sweet,salty, but spiced to perfection addition that is a perfect dunk to crab, lobster, shrimp or of course crawfish. However, many of my friends like the boil special in their bags. To each their own, the beauty of this place is that you can try many different combinations till you find your favorite. (And trust me, its impossible to only go to the boil once... it will quickly become your favorite spot) -The food: (Outside of the perfect seafood that has yet to ever be even remotely off). The chicken wings are hands down the best I have ever had. Skin is perfectly crispy, meet is juicy and falls off the bone, spice (While I dont know what their special recipe is, is UNREAL). Ambiance: Its the only seafood place that can somehow make a cold winter night feel cozy. The music is perfect. TV's are always playing sports... nothing beat Sunday football snacking on bags of crawfish and beer. However, it also manages to be romantic if on a date.. or fun if in a group. Again, the owners nailed the landing here. I rarely yelp.. but this place deserve the 5 stars... and more.",9,7,8,6

She suggested Becco's where she had dined for work related events. I was hesitant at first, thinking the restaurant's proximity to Times Square would make it a tourist trap, flying on the heels of Lydia's celebrity. It turns out, it was a wonderful experience. Lucky for us, as a party of two, we were promptly seated, without reservations. Thinking that its description made it a great deal, I ordered the Zuppa di Pesce Misto -- I believe I ended up paying $30 with tip for this. The dish was better than I had expected -- with chunks of fresh tasting salmon, jumbo shrimps, maybe calamari, scallops, and mussels as well. That is an incredible deal!

I also get a 10% discount just for checking in on Yelp, so that's another reason why I keep returning. The beef chow fun is also really good, but a bit on the salty side. I tried the pan fried dumplings too; it was just okay. Also, the bathroom here is pretty nice compared to the other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood so I was pleasantly surprised.

Honestly, I think the kitchen was just hit hard last time and they sent some food out they probably shouldn't have, but tonight was just flawless. The beet and goat cheese salad is a must! Such a delicate creamy goat cheese that sits atop a beautiful cake of richly colored and incredibly fresh/sweet beets - easily one of my favorites. My husband enjoyed the French onion soup and foie gras immensely and I did something I never do - eat red meat. I went for the steak frites and loved it! Perfectly cooked, tender juicy steak (I swear I usually don't even like steak), and exquisite fries - I will crave them for days, I'm sure. The other couple we went with enjoyed the duck and cheeseburger and the kale we ordered as a side was amazing. The Ile Flottante I had again for dessert was the perfect ending. What really impressed me was the service - Mary was lovely and so attentive, and the tall French guy (sorry I don't know the name!) was so pleasant and genuine. While we certainly weren't going to order what we had last time, what we did have really impressed all of us and we will definitely be back for more!

Just well-seasoned meat on a fluffy bed of rice drowned in a delicious white sauce. It's as if David Beckham (the manliest guy in the world) shot magic all up in my mouth. Yes, that good. Also, yeshetero. Random tips: 1) I love spicy food as much as anyone I know (to the extreme, I'll drink bottles of 500K+ Scoville unit 'designer' hot sauces for fun), but don't overdo it on the red sauce. You want to fully taste how good these plates are. 2) Even if you don't like lamb, go for the combo platter. I usually think lamb tastes like a weird mix of flowers, gamey-ness, and meat, but it's well done here and the chicken alone does seem like it'd be a touch bland. 3) Lastly, some cabbie told me that you can jump the primary line by telling these dudes you're in the 'cab line.'

624,149416,859,3/12/13,"Hands down my fav place to hit up for yakitori and my comfort food spot when I spend any length of time in NYC.  I have to fight the urge not to eat here all the time just so I can sample other meals in the city.  I try to sit at the bar right in front of the people grilling since they tend to serve you directly as opposed to having to wait for the servers (hit or miss with waitstaff) to bring your food to the table.  I've come to realize that you just have to be a little bit aggressive with the waitstaff to get what you need (other dishes, drinks, check), hence minus 1 star.  This arrangement really only works for 2 people dining together though unless you grab the corner section of the bar where it bends around (and even then, max of 4).  The skewers are definitely more pricey than some of the other spots around the city, but it is hands-down the one. The following are some of my top skewer choices from the menu:  - tsukune or nankotsu tsukune in tare sauce (chicken meatball)    - negi buta-toro pon (pork belly with scallion in ponzu sauce)  - harami (skirt steak with onions and peppers)    - kuruma ebi (prawn)    - hiza nankotsu (knee cartilage)*  - soriresu ('chicken oyster' [aka really juicy nugget of thigh meat near the joint])*  - yaki onigiri with tare sauce (though this last one may be a fav since it reminds me of some really great street food I used to have when I lived in Japan) *Hiza nankotsu and soriresu tend to run out early since they're the 'limited' items. One time when I got here right when they opened, I heard them call out they had 10 orders of the former and 20 of the latter.  Not sure if this is typical, but FYI... The other skewer items are very solid (e.g. things like the various veggies), but the ones above are those they do particularly well.  With a bowl of white rice, a set of skewers makes a perfect meal for me.   Other menu items (appetizers, entrees) are on the most part good, but nothing that I would go out of my way for.  I stick to the skewers since I don't want to waste any room in my stomach. NB  They take reservations for lunch (GREAT LUNCH SPECIALS), so definitely call in ahead of time lest you want to end up languishing in line while smelling the grilling food for the next half hour.",8,4,9,5

A few different areas like a fish section, a pasta section, a meat and cheese section, whatever, I've def had better at other places.. You go here for the experience and that's it... If you get annoyed in large amounts of foot traffic, Body odor and a  strong fishy smell then don't go here... Also, the waiter Joseph K, completely rude.. Like guy don't take it out on me bc you're middle aged and working as a waiter at eataly. Anytime my friend and I asked him a question his response was ""nope"" or ""yep"" like hath you no Proper English skills let alone table side manner.. Truly pissed me off. I'm mad I actually went here and wasted an hour and a half of my life and $60. I walked around the block to rosa Mexicano bc we were still hungry ! Much more satisfying !",1,9,2,8

Not the best that I've had, but it's still very good! The grand slam is definitely well worth your money and usually lasts me two meals.

Dirt. Grim. Bugs. oh emmm geee what the hell is that on the wall!!! someone give me a surgical mask! latex gloves! i'm scared i might leave this bathroom and catch an STD!!! ....at this moment i was contemplating how badly did I have to go to the bathroom. perhaps i should hold it in and risk all the terrible medical diseases you can get from not peeing when you are suppose to. or maybe i should just go pee outside in some corner because that has GOT to be cleaner... anyho lesson of the day: make sure you go to the bathroom before entering the corner bistro. order the corner bistro burger [it's amaazziinng!]. and make sure you have cash. otherwise you may have to  scrub the floor of that disgusting bathroom to pay your bill. ::shivers::,3,9,2,8

It was okay, but I think it lacked enough cheese to classify it as poutine.  I split a pork belly dish and the chicken fried steak with my friend.  The pork belly dish was more of a salad with small slivers of pork belly.  It wasn't bad, but I felt a little misled into getting a salad.  The chicken fried steak was tasty, but a little too starchy.  Probably won't come here again because it is so far east, but not bad if you're in the neighborhood.

The decor and interior was cute, I enjoyed it very much, the music was great- but my good times stopped there. The table was off by like an inch on one leg, which caused a very severe ""rocking"" back and forth... the woman who seated us said she'd be ""right back to fix it"" then never did, even though the place had 6 other patrons in it, and 4 staff. Our lovely waitress was near useless. She saw the table moving violently at one point, and just walked on by. My bf put his foot on on leg, to steady it- for the entire meal. Thank God for big feet, eh? So yeah. I didn't know what to get, so I asked our waitress. She said ""everything is good."" Yeah, I said- but what about these two? I pointed between the chirizo/eggs and the heuvos rancheros. She just snidely said ""the huevos is more Mexican, the chirizo more Argentinian"" Yeah. Ok, like I didn't know that. I just wanted to know which one the chef cooked better. My bf picked the rancheros, me the chirizo, and a coffee. The coffee wasn't bad at all. The chirizo dish was pathedic. The rancheros, near perfect, my bf reported. Of course, I thought. The sausage was paste-dry, served with completely DRY bread with hard crust, and some overcooked scrambled eggs. Yes, I ordered them scrambled, but geez, not scrambled plus 5 minutes. Then the potatoes. So, let's recap. dry, dry, dry, dry and er... dry. The flavors were decent, and of good quality, but it was apparent the chef didn't cook well, or didn't care that particular moment. My bf happily ate the entire rancheros plate, and offered me one delicious bite. Turns out the Chef is Mexican. What a surprise! (no, really, he is, and whoo boy can he cook awesome Mexican food, but I would avoid the chirizo ""Argentinian"" style stuff at all costs) The waitress really did me in though. She simply ignored us most of the meal, and when we directly asked for the check after 30 minutes of sitting there waiting for eye contact (with maybe 14 patrons at this point) she still ignored us another 10 minutes. We asked again, and the bill came. I was still hungry. I couldn't stomach the whole plate, and it wasn't much to begin with. I really wanted what my bf had- but wasn't about to spend another $10 here for such crappy service and overpriced food. Plus, we'd been there a loooong time just waiting for the bill. So I left hungry and grumpy, until I had a good slice of pizza up the road. (:",2,9,1,9

They have a great Prime rib sandwich for lunch that i purchase from during my lunch break. Well roasted, lots of au jus and great bread. A wide selection of cheeses and charcuterie. You can definitely make a day of it in here. I've also tried the pizza section.

Needless to say, come with people you like, as everyone's fingers are touching your food. Communal eating for the win! This was such a fun meal. They send you a menu beforehand so you can pick what you want included in your feast. Our spread included sausages, prawns, roasted chicken, plaintains, lumpiang, and bicol express (pulled pork shoulder). Everything is served atop a heap of garlic rice. It's fun to take a before-and-after photo. Get messy: there is no way to pick up stew with your bare hands like a lady. There will be way too much food. Go easy on the cocktails as many of them are heavy with coconut milk, and you need that stomach capacity for more important tasks.

Perhaps because it rocks? (hehe) The spaghetti was fully cooked (not al dente), which I like, but also not mushy. And the crabmeat and shrimp on top were both great. It didn't taste at all like it had ever been frozen. Several other diners in my party had different varieties of fish and everybody seemed quite pleased with their orders.

It was soft, warm and seasoned perfectly. The mustard chicken penne was something I had to have. I've never thought of putting mustard and pasta together. The cream balanced out the intensity of the mustard and it balanced perfectly with the penne. The salmon fettucini was great as well, especially since it had a good amount of salmon. For dessert we shared the banana flambe√© crepe...deeelishus...I didn't try any wine because my favorite beer bar, Spuyten Duyvel, is right around the corner. 5 stars",9,5,8,5
681,18028,689,12/24/13,"Food was good, and I would love to elaborate on that, but the service was lacking, and this is what stands out the most. I went for brunch/lunch during the weekday and they weren't that busy. But once we got our food, no one refilled our water, no one asked how our food was, no one offered pepper to us (they did to the couple next to us), no one cleaned up our dirty coffee mugs which were finished very early on, and no one asked us if we wanted anything else. So I feel like after we were served, we were left to our own devices, as if eating at a fast food joint. And after eating we sat for a long time without anyone noticing we were done eating (which was awkward to begin with each time new customers would walk up and look around for a table and we were just sitting there twiddling our thumbs). So after a long wait and finally getting the check, I am conflicted about tipping. Yes, thank you for carrying my food from the kitchen to my table, but everything else was missing from the whole dining experience. The worst part is that our table was right next to the order terminal, so the waiter walked past us a million times (but then again, I am not even sure who my waiter is, because he never came back). Petite Abeille, I wanted to like you and the food was even good enough, but some improvements definitely need to be made before I'd go back for a $50 brunch and have this experience.",3,6,4,4

684,1931,257,8/21/11,"Brunch review only. Yum! I liked both the bread & the strawberry butter, just not together. They did not pair well, which made me a little sad because I had high expectations from all the positive reviews.   The french toast had a perfect ratio of fruit & cinnamon on top. The centers of the french toast were fantastic, cooked to perfection. Unfortunately the crust and edges were a little overdone and chewy. As a whole it was still really good. I ordered potatoes on the side.. yum!!! Love the seasoning and grilled onions! mmm.. I was a little bummed I didn't get to try the Bellini or Mimosa since we came in around 1120 on a Sunday and were seated right away (for out of towners: its against NY law to serve alcohol before noon on a Sunday). The OJ & coffee that come with brunch were enjoyable though. Service was awesome. Shared onion rings which were pretty good, and a great alternative to the brunch fry. Everyone I was with seemed to thoroughly enjoy their food :) If you're in the area I definitely recommend this place. Personally I wouldn't go out of my way for it.. Before 1130 there is no wait at all. We left around 1230 there was a HUGE crowd waiting outside. If you don't have reservations ahead of time, this is a good spot for an earlier brunch since it doesn't get packed until after noon.",6,5,7,6
685,7985,263,8/31/10,"I've always thought Scott Conant was a harsh critic on TV, but now I know he's just holding other chefs to his high standards. DInner at Scarpetta was a simple, wonderful, delicious meal. Bread Basket - I'm not a huge fan of the bread basket at most restaurants, but the bread here was so wonderfully fresh and yummy, I had a couple of pieces. I can't remember all the different types of bread offered, but all the ones I ate were good. The best one was definitely the stromboli, stuffed with smoked mozzarella, salami, basil, and cherry tomato. I wish more restaurants served bread like this! I slathered the rest of the bread in olive oil, eggplant caponata and mascarpone butter. I could eat this bread basket every day! Braised short ribs of beef w/ vegetable and farro risotto - The short ribs were so tender, no knife was needed. The risotto w/ the sauce was rich, wonderful and oh so tasty. Creamy polenta w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms - A touch salty, but  a perfect marriage of the smooth, creamy polenta and the rich, flavorful mushrooms. The truffle oil really highlights the earthy flavor of the mushrooms and takes this dish from good to great. Spaghetti w/ tomato and basil - I have never had spaghetti like this before. I've read the rave reviews of this dish, but was always a bit skeptical - how good can a simple spaghetti dish be? Apparently, really, really good. The perfect tomato sauce paired with perfectly al dente noodles, need I say more? Duck and foie gras ravioli w/ marsala reduction - The ravioli filling is creamy and delicious. although there isn't a strong flavor of duck. The marsala reduction is good and doesn't overwhelm the rest of the dish. Black tagliolini w/ mixed seafood, sea urchin and minted bread crumbs - This is one of the best black pastas I've ever had. This is the first time I""ve had black pasta with uni and I have to say, I really loved it. Seafood was cooked well and not chewy, but my fave part of the dish was the minted bread crumbs. Beautiful restaurant, great food, fast service, I'll definitely be coming back again.",9,7,8,6
686,12481,166,11/11/11,"I love Kafana. I am part Serbian so it is nice to have a place in the city where I can eat food from home when I miss it - and Kafana always delivers. I've been here a couple of times and the food is always outstanding and very authentic. Their Mesano Meso (Mixed Meat) platter is great, and can feed two, or even three people comfortably. The Zeljanica and Lepinja sa Kajmakom appetizers are also delicious. I especially recommend getting the Lepinja - the kajmak was the highlight of one of my meals at Kafana and if you are particularly looking to try something very unique and Serbian, kajmak is it. I've also had the Karadjordjeva which is delicious, and very very filling. The only thing I didn't care for is their wine list - none of the wines I had at Kafana stood out. Service is decent, the wait staff is friendly, but not too overwhelming. Sometimes it's hard to flag them down to get the check, but I am willing to overlook that. My dinner companions, who are American, loved Kafana and can't wait to go back. It's a great place for any meat lover or anyone wanting to try something different.",8,6,7,5

From the moment you walk in, you're hit with a fun, hip vibe with CHELSEA written all over it. The waiters are all in skinny jeans with perfectly coiffed hair... and on Halloween, they were dressed to the nines, with elaborate avant-garde costumes showing lots of skin. It was really impressive, actually. The service has always been polite, if not a little aloof, but I've never had a problem with anyone there. It's feels crowded most of the time, and the food is most like ""upscale"" diner food - don't get me wrong, it's delicious! I've gotten their mac and cheese tasting (highly recommend), angus burger sliders, crispy calamari salad, fried chicken salad, lamb sausage sandwich, salmon BLT, grilled mahi mahi, pumpkin seed crusted salmon, and pulled pork sandwich in the past... I've gotten the calamari salad multiple times because I like it so much, and their Blue Plate special changes depending on the day (if they ever have a crabcake special - DEFINITELY get it!). OH, and their pre-meal biscuits are awesome. They have a kick to them (don't know what they put in their batter), and it goes nicely with the sweet butter. Their mocktails are also fabulous - I've tried them all, but the aloe vera lemonade is my all time fave. The prices are decent, mostly in the mid-teens to low-20s, but it can add up fast with a few drinks. I'd give it 5 stars but my friend got a stomachache after the meatloaf.",7,3,6,2

Looks a little unappetizing, but it tastes so good, especially with the garlic rice (which is amazing, please please get it).  With the pork chunks, so good, just great flavors and textures. -Lumpiang.  A little oily, but you get 3 (or 4?) long pieces, and they're quite good.  Definitely shareable, definitely try it. -Kare kare.  Oxtail.  We liked it a lot (though someone told us later it's a bit of a touristy dish).  It had a good amount of meat, and the peanut sauce was pretty good too. We also had some drinks (the names of which escape me), which were okay but otherwise forgettable.

Despite being incredibly full I wouldn't let the back waiter take my plate because I just couldn't part with the deliciousness. My sister had the Duck Confit Hash. Yum. Just yum. The duck was so flavorful and tender. The staff was polite and attentive. It was very busy but they were turning tables quickly and efficiently and no one seemed in the weeds.

We didn't have to wait long at lunchtime on a Thursday, and once inside the service was swift (occasionally maybe a bit impersonal with how many people they shuffle through). But the real reason you're out here -- the pizza -- is worth the trip.  For the two of us, a small pizza was plenty of food, and I'd save the large for a group of at least three or four.  Everything about it was foldable, delicious and mozzarella-dripping. Grimaldi's is a great example of an iconic NY eaterie that has made it big and scaled well to its popularity (unlike some other places).  We'd definitely come back.",7,8,6,7

We did a half vodka, half ham, artichoke and olive pizza. So ridiculously good. The crust was amazing. We also had some lobster bisque which was pretty good also. The service was great.

Between my fiance & I, we've had a few different entrees and they have all turned out great. The Pork Souvlaki comes with two well balanced sides of tasty potato chips and a very crisp, scrumptious greek salad.  The sandwich itself was great with very tender pork on a bed of lettuce, feta, and one of the most amazing tzatziki sauces that I've ever tasted.  The pita that it was wrapped in did not go unnoticed, either.  Definitely 5 stars. The Mussels are very tender and tasty, and the sauce that they come with is out of this world.  Feel free to ask for extra bread and/or pita because you will want to soak this up.  Another 5 star option. The Sheep's Milk Dumplings dish was another amazing entree put out by this great local restaurant.  The dumplings were very fresh & cheesy and they were included with Greek sausage, feta, peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  Don't overlook the sausage because it added an amazing extra flavor that really helped to make it my favorite dish here.  5 stars, yet again.

However, I was extremely upset with my recent visit to this Grey Dog in Chelsea. Finding a live, crawling beetle in my salad did not disappoint me as much as the way the obnoxious manager handled it. Let me explain: After my companion and I paid for two salads, soup and a bottle of wine, we sat to enjoy our meal. When I was halfway into my entree, I noticed that a LIVE BEETLE was crawling out from the leaves. I calmly stood up and called over the server. After about 10 minutes the manager finally came over to clear my plate. But she didn't apologize! Instead she said ""WE'RE SUPER ORGANIC HERE."" Yeah, literally farm to table. So then she finally cleared my plate, but only offered to pay for my salad and not the rest of the meal or at the very least my companion's salad as well (who did not want to finish hers because of the beetle found in mine). After I expressed my dissatisfaction with the way this situation was handled -- I very politely suggested that perhaps she should cover the expense of my friend's untouched meal -- the manager then tried to make me feel stupid by saying, ""OH? You don't like the way this was taken care of? What would you like me to do? I am at your mercy."" At this point, I did not want to argue. This manager was clearly not seeking points in the ""customer satisfaction"" department. All in all, I'm upset that I can no longer go back to Grey Dog Chelsea. I never want to see this manager again. A week later, I'm still upset over how the situation went down.

This is a self-service place with a great selection of korean staples that you grab right off of the shelf. There's also a hot buffet with a bunch of goodies.

731,7442,63,2/22/11,"I ate dinner here on a late Friday night with a friend and a few years ago, i ate here with a group of friends for a birthday party. At 1st glance, you think this place is small and cozy. It actually opens up because there is a private dining area downstairs. I remember enjoying the food here the 1st time around, which is why i recommended this place to my friend this past Friday night for dinner. I was afraid that we wouldn't get seated without reservations but we got seated right away around 9:15pm. Yes it was a late dinner, which is why they were able to accomodate us. Again, i like to reiterate that this place is small and cozy. Tables are small and are near each other.. It's a bit uncomfortable and a bit loud but the food makes up for the external environment. The complementary bread was yummy. The olive oil on the table tasted very fresh and top of the line. We skipped apps and went straight for entrees. My friend ordered the Spaghetti with shiitake mushrooms, arugula, hot chilies, basil. I have to admit the dish was a bit oily and there were a lot of mushrooms. However, it all worked together. The earthy tangyness of the shiitake mushrooms with the perfectly cooked al dente pasta was top notched. It was yummy. I ordered the Grilled Pork Chop with bacon mac & cheese, smoked chili sauce. The pork chop was a bone in and it was cooked to perfection. It was moist with a nice outer crust and it was not dry at all. The bacon mac&cheese was gooey with a nice top crust. The bacon was thick and tasted more like pancetta than your typical bacon. The smoked chili sauce had a nice bbq smokey flavor which worked with the pork chop. The dish also came with a mixed salad on the plate. We were pretty full from our entrees so we decided to share a trio of sorbets. The flavors they offered was champagne, passion fruit and strawberry. The trio worked and complemented each other perfectly. You got the mild bitterness of the champagne, with the tartness of the passion fruit and the sweetness of the strawberry. My fave was the passion fruit while my least fave was the strawberry. As my friend indicated, the strawberry tasted more like strawberry flavored chapstick. The champagne tasted like a champagne which was pretty cool since that is the 1st time i had a champagne flavored dessert. The passion fruit tasted just like what a passion fruit tastes like. It was awesome. The food here is top notch and awesome. If only they can get a bigger venue. They have a decent drink selection too. I hear that the place is popular for brunch but i have never been. I must try it one day.",7,5,6,4

Came in to the small shop (they have seating next door) and ordered my roll from the very pleasant girl behind the counter. Had to get the original Maine style because when I go to places that are known for a specialty item my rule is try ""the original"" before I branch out.  The Maine style is 1/4 lb of lobster meat,tossed with just a hint of Mayo, lemon, celery, some paprika and a smattering of chopped green onions on a small bed of shredded lettuce in a split top hot dog bun.  On a beautiful summer day, a rare non muggy one it was the perfect taste of summer on a Tuesday afternoon stuck at work. Juicy, tender and every bite was delicious.

I use to work around the corner so I would always order one for lunch and an extra one to bring home. My only complaint is they never give me enough of the soy sauce or the sweet chili sauce. The haianese chicken and rice is so much more worth it when you order it to go as oppose to in the restaurant because they give you so much more rice. That chicken broth rice is delicious. Sometimes I ponder in traveling out to New York just to order it and bring it back home. I've had their roti telur - which is the roti with the eggs and onions and it's passable. I would like to try their other appetizers. I've had some of their noodle dishes as well but for some reason they just don't compare. There may be some bias in there ;D I do believe though that if you're ever in New York, in the Chinatown area this would be a nice restaurant to dine in - especially since it's so good and cheap.

I had the bacon wrapped hot dog, which came with a variety of sauces and a beer mustard - all delicious and gone within a few seconds of being placed in front of my face.

My experience alone is worthy of 5 stars, but the food stands on its own as one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC. Where to begin...upon entering Barbuto my colleague and I were amazed to find Jonathan Waxman AND Rick Moonen sitting down for a meal. It blew us away simply because moments like this do occur in NYC, but usually not for us hahaha After finally closing the wide open gap that was my mouth, we waited for our table over a bottle of Soave that was just perfectly crisp, with a hint of fruit that danced on my palate. The dinner finally arrived and we decided on the insalata caprese, the gnocchi pomodoro, and the pollo al forno. The insalata was amazingly fresh, the heirloom tomatoes were huge and tasty, while the mozzarella was moist and perfect. The Gnocchi Pomodoro was another amazing surprise. The mix of gnocchi, corn and tomatoes was both tasty, fresh and robust. Then came the big daddy, the pollo al forno (the Jon Waxman special). Hands down one of the best chicken dishes I've ever devoured. It was expertly seasoned, perfectly cooked and moist. My stomach is grumbling just thinking about it! Superb is an underrated word to describe the meal. All in all ... a great meal. The cherry on top came afterward, as we were leaving my colleague and I wound up having a drink with the very welcoming Rick Moonen. Conversation was light and the grappa was superb.

At that point..the least you could do is apologize and and tell us to have a good night. Nope.

Hello Trader Joe's, Hill Country Chicken, and that lovely little pop-up market right outside Madison Square Park, goodbye overpriced but highly convenient Korean deli. Unfortunately, Eataly isn't really contributing to neighborhood-wide ""Make Amy's lunch better"" push. I like the concept of the to-go counter. A limited selection, chosen among dishes that will survive a wait with minimal quality loss, credit cards only...these are all logical and sensible. Service was also pleasant, friendly, knowledgeable, and apologized sincerely enough for my ten-minute wait to suggest it genuinely was an aberration. However, on the critical price/quality ratio, Eataly To Go falls flat. My $12 serving of pasta was tossed with a tasty tomato sauce, but the flavor profile relied too much on an aggressive hand with the salt. Moreover, the sort of touches that might have elevated the experience (olive oil for the bread (which was the best part of the meal)? fresh pepper for the pasta?) were conspicuously missing. The pizzas may be a better option, but with most pies priced $14+, that's just more than I'm willing to pay for a lunch that will be eaten at my desk.

Not to mention, it is a revelation that you can get such healthy, fresh food so quickly. My favorite cold dish (you can get them a la carte, three at a time, or two at a time with one hot dish) is the Curried Freekah with Cauliflower, Mango, and Cashews. My favorite hot dish is the Spanish Spice Rub Roasted Chicken. The soups are amazing, too - I am obsessed with the Chicken and Barley Soup with Broccoli! Also, if you want a house-made drink with lunch, the pomegrante-berry tea is killer. I will most definitely be coming back to Mulberry and Vine (Let's be honest- probably sometime this week) for the atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food.

I went for lunch at around 1:30pm. The hostess said it'd be a 45 minute wait. That seemed longer than the no-wait advertised on the site, but I was ok with it. 45 minutes passed and no table.  I asked the hostess if she could estimate how much longer it'd be, and she said a couple minutes more or 20 minutes max at worst case scenario. One hour and no table. It wasn't until another 30 minutes passed that a table became available. Sat down and waited 10 minutes for the waiter to stop by and take my order. So after 2 hours total of waiting (waiting for a table, waiting for the waiter, waiting for the food) I got my burger and was excited to devour it. The medium rare beef was overpowered by globs of bleu cheese. Every bite I took was a mouthful of bleu cheese. I really wanted to like this burger, but all I could taste was the toe jam cheese. I tried to erase the funk from my taste buds by eating the fries, but those were so over-salted that it just blistered my mouth. Overall, a disappointing experience. I really wanted to love this place. The second floor is very charming and a nice little spot. Unfortunately, the service and the food didn't live up to its hype for me. I'd be willing to give it another try if I didn't have to wait an hour and a half for a table during lunch. I was originally going to give this place 2 stars, but the waiter came through at the end and was pleasant, attentive, and quick to give me my check when I asked for it (the table next to me waited 20 minutes for theirs). Word of advice: whatever wait time they tell you, double it and that's how long you'll actually wait for a table.",2,3,1,4
779,40654,356,11/23/11,"If I had to write a review about this bar within the first few seconds of entering on Friday night, I would probably have given it three stars. Pretty decent atmosphere, not uncomfortably crowded, but no real music. A laid back atmosphere to down a few before heading somewhere else. Or so I thought. Why the one star? Simply put, the service was god awful. But service usually stinks in a crowded bar on a Friday night, you say? Not like this. Seriously, though. I've been in crowded bars before, and most bartenders have enough tact to say something along the lines of ""I'll be with you in a second"", ""Just a sec"", or even a simple hand gesture to indicate that your presence has been acknowledged. Apparently that's too much to ask at this place. After being rudely told to ""Hold up"" numerous times, and after being called ""bossy"" for having the audacity to request eight shots of a ridiculously easy-to-make SoCo and Lime (which they managed to butcher anyway), I decided to leave a tip that I felt was pretty much commensurate with the service I received from the two bartenders. I, of course, was called out for leaving such a ""low"" tip (even though it was more than 10%). I'd call that VERY geneous, all things considered. I walked out of the bar with a friend, and one of the busty gargolyes actually FOLLOWED ME OUTSIDE to tell me that I'm no longer welcome at the bar. Heh. I don't think they were referring to me, everyone. According to the bartenders, NO ONE is ever welcome here. Stay. Away.",1,6,2,7

I've been known to heat up water and throw a bullion cube inside for a hot, salty, and meaty little treat in my day... so learning of a broth bar opening up 1/2 block from my apartment was quite the fun little discovery. It's essentially a pop up window on the 1st Avenue side of Hearth in East Village, and so far with my first taste of their Hearth Broth (combination of chicken, turkey, and beef sipping broths), it's going to a regular stop of mine throughout fall and winter. They seem to be in soft opening mode currently as their menu isn't 100% available (they have some actual soups to go along with their sipping broths), but I can't imagine it'll be too long before they're fully operational and lines form as the cold descends on the city. In addition to the signature Hearth Broth, they have a straight chicken broth and a grass fed beef broth. I didn't see a vegetarian option on their menu, but depending on your dietary preferences that may or may not be an issue for you at all. Excited to see how the concept fares! It's certainly something I've yet to see in my 32+ years of eating and drinking things.",8,6,7,7

797,5718,16,1/1/13,"While in New York visiting friends a group of six of us had a late dinner here.This was a week post-Sandy and Con-Ed trucks were still in the streets. I don't know if it was the time of night or the ages of some in the party or what but it was a pretty bland and unimpressive event. I am very much predisposed to like a Danny Meyer establishment and thus everything that followed was very disappointing. The restaurant is very nice and has an unassuming charm. White table clothes and cool little work stations. After being seated the fun kinda ended. We let the youngest of the party order first, maybe a mistake, all she wanted was a salad, our waitress balked. What she said I can't recall exactly but it was along the lines of, ""This is a restaurant for adults so you all better order some real food."" This after the order of one person, who was clearly a kid, unlike the rest of the party. I assured her the rest of the table was planning on making real orders and then we did. Sadly it didn't seem to change her attitude toward our table. With the order in we sat back to have our drinks and bread. Shortly there after our not chastened and defiantly not apologetic waitress returned to inform me that the meat dish (was it the duck?) I ordered was out of stock. But, she continued, I should have this other, more expensive, dish.  Already feeling cheapened by her attitude I said, ""Sure"" and tried to asked like that had been the dish I really wanted all along. The food ranged from fair to excellent. The items mentioned favorably in the press were as advertised but a lot of the other items just seemed like half-baked menu fillers. Because it was a big party we were adventurous in our ordering and hit about 75% of the menu. Our adventurousness was not repaid.   The food: fair, service: poor, restaurant: nice, bill: very high. I could have four starred this place if they had just met basic expectations, sadly they did not. Did I mention how concerned the GM was with how we folded our napkins when we left the table. He literally came by twice to fix the napkins. Didn't really check on us to see how the meal was, maybe he already knew.   I could give a f about the money, I just want the night back",3,8,1,7
798,80877,883,3/5/13,"My co-workers and I come here fairly often for lunch, and I cannot wait to visit Juniper for dinner.  It is truly one of our favorite spots, our dish of choice being the Steak and Cheese which is one of the best I've ever had.  I walk away thinking about this thing all the time, and was pretty obsessed with it for quite some time. Almost all the dishes you'll find here will fall under comfort foods.  And while I do wish there were a few more healthier options, you won't be disappointed with anything you get here. The portions are enormous and the fries (of all their different varieties) are quite addicting.  Burgers are perfectly cooked and tasty.  The fish dishes are soooo yummy and hugely sized.    If you're looking for a cheap lunch, the grilled cheese is a great deal and comes with Tom's super awesome french fries of your choice.  The salads are enormous and delicious.  The ribs are deboned and very tasty and the jambalya is generously flavored and portioned (though a bit too spicy for my tastes, I'm a wimp though).  I love the Steak and Cheese so much that I hardly eat anything else here. There isn't a single disappointing thing on this menu. The prices are reasonable, and while a bit high for lunch is definitely good for dinner. Tom, the owner and chef, is one of the sweetest restaurant owners you'll ever meet and he never fails to come and greet us and chat with us upon our visits.  He has done an excellent job making the restaurant feel quite homey in its personality.  You will find not a trace of pretentiousness.  It is simple in design, but you will certainly leave full and happy.  The friendly waitstaff has always been very attentive to us. There is also a very lovely and spacious garden in the back.

The brisket was great, but the bread may have been sitting out a while. With that said, order their beans and dump it on the sandwich and it becomes a saucy brisket-ey sloppy joe type of concoction. Loved it! Their wings were good, but if you're at a BBQ place, stick with the BBQ.   I love the cafeteria style. Most of the staff are doing their thing in the kitchen, at the counter serving food or at the register. There's one person overlooking everything from counting capacity so that it isn't overflowing with too many people, moving the line along, problem solving and it's handled very well so that everything moves about smoothly.

There are two dining areas, each seating 20ish, separated from the bar area by the hotel entrance. We were in the inner room, which was pretty quiet. We went with the 4 course. Bread choices are between normal or olive mini baguettes with soft butter and this olive spread. There was an array of amuse bouche - I was a big fan of the warm truffle potato. For starters, the live scallop was amazing..buttery and sweet. The gnocchi with peekytoe crab was creamy and delicious. The egg and tiny bit of uni upped the savoriness. For fish, the peas added a sweet tinge to the halibut. I preferred the bass, which was perfectly cooked and on the vinegary side. For meats, I really liked the morel mushrooms and mushroom broth with the nicely done veal tenderloin. I preferred the rabbit, which was tender and came with an assortment of young carrots. For desserts, the chocolate with jasmine was good, but I liked the mango ricotta more. I loved the green tea macadamia from the petit fours. Overall great food, great presentation, great service, though the d√©cor could use some color. The portions are definitely on the smaller size, and it's pretty pricey for how much food you get, but each dish has a lot of depth.",7,6,6,4

Sure, they're ""craft"" pickles, but at the end of the night, there are grocery store brands more satisfying.  There are also pickled beets, carrots, and asparagus.  The asparagus was hardly edible. Had the leek sausage, and this was really great.  Decent beer selections, but the prices are high and the glasses are small. Bottom Line: Some of the items are way overpriced. Great decor, okay service.  Probably wouldn't visit again.  The pickles need to step it up a notch.",3,6,4,5
806,23577,78,8/17/13,"After first waiting at our table for about 15 minutes without anyone coming by, our first server decided to make an appearance and when doing so she was incredibly rude, rolling her eyes when my group made simple requests, like water, and wasn't interested in explaining their menu to us (which is on the wall btw, so make sure to bring your glasses). She acted like we were a burden when we asked questions about the items on the menu but the fact is the menu has no descriptions and uses italian words that the average American person doesn't know (and this restaurant is in times square... come on now). The food was okay but somewhat overpriced, especially bc of the horrible service.  The only thing that saved the entire experience was a waiter named Leo who was very helpful and nice. He took over our table midway through our meal and really turned things around. The busboys were nice as well. Overall, I will never go back to this restaurant- there are too many other amazing Italian restaurants (that are actually family owned and authentic) in New York to even waste a minute thinking about going back to this place.",2,5,1,4

The breads and pastries and even hearty looking pretzels were all on display at the front end of the bar.  There's coffee and a full bar as well.  The decor feels very industrial chic crossed with a coffee house vibe.  Granted this was because I came for lunch....could be a totally different story at dinner time.

813,62185,414,8/12/12,"Mmmmmmm..... balls. Sorry, I couldn't resist saying that! I tasted some great balls at the MEATBALL shop, where more than once I had to fight down the urge to laugh uncontrollably every time someone said the word ""balls"", and especially when the menu said that sides could be served ""under your balls""... oh, dear... proof of innocence lost! I was dying to ask our waitress ""what if we don't have any balls?"" but I wasn't ballsy enough to ask and didn't want to embarrass my friends who had, without a doubt, cleaner minds than I did :) Okay, I got that out of my system. Time for my review. We waited around 20 minutes for a table outside, which I didn't mind since we weren't the only ones loitering on the sidewalk, and the Meatball Shop was predictably packed. Once we were seated, our waitress passed the menus, which were laminated in order for us to mark our selections right on them. Markers were provided at the table. Extra points for creativity! I ordered the Smash, which is two balls smashed (eek!) on a toasted bun with sauce, cheese, and a side salad. I chose spicy pork balls, mushroom sauce, and provolone cheese, and that was the winning combination for me. The spicy pork balls, well, I don't know if I would call them spicy, they had a bit of a kick to them, but not enough for me to down my glass of water. However, they were delicious with the provolone cheese, but where's the sauce? The smash had just enough to be flavorful, but I love my meatballs drowned in sauce so it was slightly disappointing, but only slightly. The salad was crisp and delish with another winning combo: apple and arugula. Even though the balls were the stars of the show, it was actually the ice cream sandwich that upstaged them and blew me away. I ordered the special of the day, brown sugar ice cream, after my friend asked for a little to taste and raved about it with a look of pure ecstasy on her face... so I got that sandwiched between a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie cookie. Then it was my turn to have a look of pure ecstasy on my face. One thing that irked me: as we started eating our desserts, the waitress thanked us and placed the check on the table. I know that it's crowded and people are waiting for tables but there's something called good manners- and I ain't rushing for no one! Thank you, The Meatball Shop, for some damn good balls :P and damn good ice cream.",8,9,9,9

I remember loving the razor clams but it wasn't available on the night we went. Must-gets: Burrata with Spanish Anchovies ""Ibizan Llifeguard Style"" -- really creamy burrata with fresh anchovies that are hard to come by. Bacalao Croquetas with Orange Alioli -- I'm not usually a fan of croquetas, given it's on the heavier side. But this one is probably one of the best one that I have had, not too greasy, the bacalao is not so strong to remind one that this is actually codfish Fideos with Chorizo and Clams -- thin noodles (a bit soft and crunchy) paella style with flavorful chorizo and clams. Never had anything like and I adore it as much as some of the best paellas Artichokes with Mint - tender and tasty artichoke, fantastic Solid dishes: Mussels with Cava and Chorizo -- fresh mussels with good balance of flavor from Chorizo Foie Gras with Cinco Cebollas -- For a San Franciscan, this is a must Cauliflower Crema with Raw Sea Urchin, Vadouvan and Puffed Rice -- Liked this dish but thought that the sea urchin could be more fresh Pulpo with Fennel and Grapefruit - this was my least favorite. The waiter told us that pulpo was grilled when it was actually fried. Still a solid dish nevertheless.

It wasn't a big deal though, so we put our name down and wandered around the neighborhood scoping out other options. About a hour passed and we decided to call to check on availability. The worker who picked up said the most ridiculous thing ever-- ""Well, you put your name down at around 7:30, and it's only been a hr, so maybe in another half hour."" EXCUSE ME?! Since when did est. time trump availability?! At this point, we were not happy with the service and decided to head to Chinatown for some actual Asian food. Suddenly, we get a text saying there is a table available for us now. Fine. Can't argue with a starving stomach. We walked in to see not one, but FIVE empty tables. RIDICULOUS. We had to wait a hr when they had FIVE freaking empty tables. And then what you ask? They seat us in the worst table possible. Right by the bathroom. All the way in the back. In a corner. We felt like victims ....of clientele profiling? What? Did we not look hip enough? Did they not expect to serve Asian food to Asians? *SHRUG* Fast forward to the food: Chicharron - Don't bother. You get better from the packaged ones at the corner bodega. Green Mango Salad - I am a fan of Thai Mango Salad. And I am a fan of fish sauce. But this salad was swimming in fish sauce and lime juice that were not evenly mixed together. It just didn't blend. And I'm not saying the ingredients they used don't go well together--they do, but just not in this case. I don't know what went wrong, but it did. Overly salted and the chicken tastes like a poor rendition of the grilled chicken you get at Viet restaurants. Grilled Pork Jowl - Wait, what? I thought I was eating the Mango Salad again. The flavors are too similar. If you HAD to order one, I guess go with this one. Also overly salted. Quail Adobo -  The flavor is not bad, but the batter just didn't work well with the quail. For a tiny poultry, the batter definitely overpowered the quail. Mussels - The best tasting item of the night came from this dish. The montao. Pretty sad that their best tasting item is a piece of bun. All in all, none of the dishes were terrible, but nothing was good either. Except for the bun. Would I come back? No. Would I recommend?

You are getting charged $13 bucks, for burger that will never fill you up and  without any taste. My Friend BEN can make this in his backyard any day, won't charge a single dime. But my point its a regular, ground beef meat with  cheese on top ( Cheese I liked) . Not sure why it has  great reviews, maybe they haven't tired other spots.   Their service was pretty good.  The ambiance was nice also . Very clean But I have noticed they have been lately getting some bad comments.   Something to think about. In conclusion I would not pay $13 bucks, more like   $6 to $8.",3,7,2,8

Since the city was still under an emergency due to the storm, a lot of staff was missing and as a result service was really bad. We were dressed as a group of witches for halloween and were very impressed by the Hostess Briana who helped us a lot and apologized for any inconvenience we encountered.

822,36920,247,4/4/13,"Holy smokes, Ippudo knows ramen. I came here at 6:30 on a Thursday night and the wait for 2 people was quoted around hour and 45 mins. Sounds ridiculous, but the cool thing is that the hostess asked for my cell phone number so I could receive texts when my table was going to be ready; so during the wait time, I walked around the neighborhood and grabbed some cookies from Momofuku Milk Bar. The even BETTER part is that I received a text after 45 minutes, much shorter wait time than what I was originally quoted. Anyhow, I ordered their spicy ""Special"" ramen of the day ($15+) and LOVED it. I don't know what all of the ingredients were, but the soup broth stood out to me most, and then the thickness of the ramen noodles itself. Ippudo did not skimp on the veggies or chashu pork, which of course I appreciated. I also tried the pork buns, which were good, but definitely NOT better than the pork buns at Momofuku. The restaurant also has a very trendy atmosphere, like a place you can chill with a small group of friends or go on a date. Highly recommended!",7,6,8,7

K started this no alcohol & sweets, eat only chicken and seafood diet, which I didn't understand when K knew we were going to have dinner. I gave K a list of places and I added Yerba Buena after H rave to me about this place but said Perry location was supposedly better. Drink Menu: I don't like to drink alcohol by myself, but I did notice they had tons of specialty cocktails, which caught both of our eyes. Oh wells, K said next time... I love spicy things so I naturally wanted to try their Lime√±o hamachi ceviche, citrus miso, jalape√±o, jicama, cucumber - the contents of this ceviche reminded me of the one at Desnuda. This was just okay and their version definitely didn't even come close to Desnuda's. I couldn't even taste the jalapeno flavour. Chicharron De Calamari - blue corn meal crusted calamari, sweet plantains, tomato salad tamarind vinaigrette - This looks a bit weird since the calamari is donned with a really saucy brown colour but surprising this dish wasn't half bad. Tacos De Pescado crispy tilapia baja style, jicama cabbage, chipotle slaw - I asked the waiter for hot sauce and he advised that I should be careful and I really need to taste the hot sauce before I go crazy with it. I told him, not to worry since I can handle spice but he insisted that I try it. WAH WAH WAH...bleh, not even spicy. I guess he was shocked to hear this so he came back and told me they didn't make it as spicy. But I am like...really, it wasn't even spicy at all to me. The fish tacos were good though and I thought the slaw was really tasty and good twist instead of using the typical red lettuce. They had ran out of their creme brulee so got the Tres Flan instead. I asked them to double up the peach flavour since I hate coconut and the third flavour is chocolate. I usually only eat Japanese Flan but their flan is actually really good - the best Spanish version I had. Attentive service and great atmosphere.",6,5,7,4

It came in a nice three tiered serving platter but the serving was actually very small and none of it tasted very good. The cost was $29, which is just insane.

Luckily for me I, was by myself and could grab a quick seat at the bar.  I really enjoyed this place.  The coffee was a yummy French Roast and the orange juice was fresh, as it should be for $3.50 a pop.  I went simple for my first time and got the Clinton Street Omelet, starting at $10 for an omelet with two add-ins, hash browns and toast.  This is possibly the best omelet I've had yet.  They were not skimpy on the mushrooms, goat cheese and bacon I chose and their homemade jam was complete perfection on the sourdough toast.  It's too bad I was too full to try to the Hot Buttered Rum, the reason I went there in the first place.  They get four stars for being a tad over-priced.",7,6,6,5

This was a little bit of a trek from the office at Roc Center, but I think it was worth it - it was also a chance to burn some extra calories. First, it is a ""seat yourself"" establishment, and the service was great. As for the food, I had a Brooklyn Lager, which they had on tap and mom had a glass of wine. I wasn't really up for being adventurous that day, but they do have a very wide variety of beer options. We both had burgers. I had the bison burger (medium) with mushrooms and avocado and mom had the grass fed burger (medium) with the same toppings. I opted for the truffle fries, and she opted for the regular fries. We both enjoyed our choices though she seemed to like mine a bit more then her own :-) and the burgers were perfectly cooked. It was a very satisfying meal, so much that I did not finish my burger and I still felt that my mom could roll me down the street and back to the office. The atmosphere was pleasant. It wasn't noisy at lunch time, so this gave us the chance to catch up on each other's lives. I imagine that this would make a great after work hang out spot.",8,6,7,7

I tried a bite of my friend's potato salad and it was really nice and refreshing. The table next to mine got the catfish and a po boy and I was jealous. Next time I come here, I will definitely have to branch out and try their other dishes. I've only ever had the jambalaya as well and that's really good.

There are wooden benches (not single chairs so be aware when you want to readjust) and tables. Some of the tables were a little loop sided but it wasn't that big of a deal since we just had our drinks on the table. The drinks additionally were very cheap, even on a weekend night so I can't imagine how much of a steal they would be during the day/ happy hours. A beer was about $7 and mixed drink around the same.

We didn't rush ourselves - but man, are these curry guys quick servers! The katsu curry with the pork cutlet is my favorite. I sampled the chicken cutlet and it was just as crispy, flavorful, and juicy as the pork. Note that all the curries are the same, and they are all made with ground pork - no vegetarian options here. Japanese curry is much more mild than other varieties - it has only the merest hint of spice, is very creamy, and is more brown than yellow in color. It makes it easier to scarf down quickly since its not going to give you a heart attack! Everyone's plate is arranged as so: big oval silver plate. An oval mound of rice covered in curry (amount varies based on your order size). Your katsu and toppings over the curry. A handful of shredded lettuce on the left side. Fork stabbed in the middle. There are maximum of 16 or so seats here - so don't count on being able to eat here. If you're by yourself, you have a much better chance of scoring a seat.

We were a large group and they  let us stayed half hour passed their closing time without making us feel rushed to leave. Very exceptional business gesture! Me and my ladies tried different appetizers.   The Fried calamari is tasteful. The shrimp is delectable . Their edamame is  heavenly. Their chicken satay is  pleasant tasting. And  these were all perfectly matched with our unique Thai iced tea. For the entree, their pad Thai  is the best pad Thai I have tasted.  Their spare ribs and steak are equivalently superb as well.  What gave us a surprise was when we tried their pana cotta dessert.  The taste is  immaculate .  Rare and to die for ! The atmosphere Is relaxing , the decoration is classically modern and presentation is exciting. Did I mentioned that they carry their trademark ( orchid) to each originally crafted food when served?

I subtracted two stars for my last two visits. On our next to last visit, the two half pies came out I e cold with hot sauce spread on top and before the appetizers. We sent them back and the people we brought there from California asked me what all the bragging was about. Just yesterday, I brought my family and two nephews from Florida 40 miles in traffic on a rainy day. This time we were fine until I asked nicely for a couple of shirts for my out of towners. Some older gentleman working there "" drilled "" them about "" where in Florida"". When the waiter came back he said, "" our order for the new year didn't come in yet so we have none"". I said I am paying for them and to double  check and if not I'll buy two hats instead, he returned and said they are out of hats too. I called the next day and asked about this and I was told clearly that there are plenty of hats and shirts because she does the ordering. So, you lie to a regular customer that just travelled 80 miles round trip with guests again, spent $200.00 plus gas?

Both of us got omelletes & biscuits, I ordered home fries well done & my buddy got the grits.   Food took forever.  When it arrived we both had 2 pieces of not toasted bread, no biscuits, freezing eggs & I had semi-raw taters.

They took the food back to toast the bread, kind of cook my potatoes a bit more.   Never asked if we wanted another drink, took forever to get a check.

The cask beer is dispensed by handpump and is always in good condition and they have a well selected rotating collection and its always available.  That's great.  However it seems they serve the cask beer in a smaller size than the keg beer.   That bugs me tremendously.  It also makes no sense.   Since cask beer, unlike keg beer, is alive and fermenting in the cask, it needs to be fresh and hence sold quickly.

869,50920,622,4/17/13,I went recently for brunch with friends and was extremely impressed with the service and the food.  Much better than the general brunch food in Hell's Kitchen. And the unlimited brunch cocktails had been made to order which was nice. Flawless service too.,9,4,8,5
870,37248,308,7/26/11,Nice place with good food.  Our first dinner in NYC so prices seemed a bit high but we understand Becco is moderate.  Our service was quick and efficient. Pasta special looked tempting but too much food.,7,4,8,5

872,67577,305,10/5/11,"Passed by here for the second time tonight and decided to stop by because it looked intriguing. Well, I was directed around the corner to their retail window, and there was quite the little line that had formed! I guess SCRATCHbread is getting its name out there. I only got the pizza bread, which was amazing!! Extremely flavorful and filling. I saw that they had a chai sticky bun, which I have to go back and try. I'm very excited that this place is a short walk away from my apartment, and even more excited that it's down the block from the YMCA. I can get a fattening baked good and then hop on down the block to work it off! In an ideal world that is what would happen, but I know with such a great place nearby I will be popping in far more often than I will be using the gym :X Oops..",9,7,9,7

It looks like a gross dive bar from the outside, but go inside and the room is cozy, the drinks are great and the food is amazing. We had the mushroom pizza, the duck gumbo, the fried chicken, and the sausage and pretzel.  There was not a miss in the bunch.  I would definitely go back.  The bar was a little bit slow but the bartenders were very friendly and the drinks were phenomenal.  My only regret was that we didn't have room for the hot chocolate with bailey's marshmallows. I will definitely be back.",9,7,9,8
875,71137,380,5/30/11,"We stopped by early for breakfast yesterday morning, and it was great. We tried two different kinds of coffee, and both were exceptionally well made, and clearly high quality.  They were both strong without being bitter. My Panamanian something or another was the stronger of the two, and it was really nice.  My better half got the Mexican Biosphere Reserve, and was definitely more mellow, something you could sit there and drink a few cups, as opposed to mine, where I felt one cup was definitely enough. Then there were the egg sandwiches.  For $3, I can't think of another place, really anywhere, that I can get an egg sandwich that good.  Perfectly prepared eggs, toasted brioche, parmesean crisp for the cheese, and to top it off a maple hot sauce, that I wanted to drink straight. It was the prefect combination of savory and sweet with a hint of heat without being overwhelmingly heavy, as egg sandwiches can be. As soon as I was done, I wanted another. They also got the OK to serve beer, so they had a good number of bottles stocked in the fridge, but at 9.30, I wans't quite ready for a beer.  Had it been after 10, that would have been a different story. I do plan on heading back soon, though, to try some of the other grilled cheese sammiches and beers.  Of all the new places to open up in Astoria, I've been most impressed with this place.  I'm not sure if it was that I went in with low expectations figuring ""well, it's just a coffee shop"" or what, but I'll certainly be returning.",8,4,9,6

The icing on the cake was the complimentary whiskey cake and the taste of wine to go along with it. The atmosphere is intimate and the noise level's just right. The manager walked around to each table introducing himself and giving you a bit of a background about the restaurant and the whiskey cake. How could I forget, I sampled some of the best oysters. They were fresh and full of flavor, my mouth's watering at the thought of it. If you're looking for a nice cozy place then Upstate's your spot.

Saturday brunch at 12pm, and while the restaurant was pretty packed, we didn't have to wait. 1.  Food: Farm House Scramble, Mushroom Omelette, and chicken sausage!  Didn't quite taste like normal food, in a good way though.  Was very delicious though!  Word of warning: chicken sausage is quite sweet, also in a good way. 2. Service: the Kitchen seems to be overstretched.  Our table, and the neighboring ones waited a while for our food. 3. Atmosphere: high ceilings, rather close quarters and loud.  Bustling with predominantly female groups and dates.  Sadly, the restaurant is located a bit out of the way.",6,4,7,4
879,29762,91,5/24/10,"I have been planning on giving this place a try for a very long time and I finally did about two weeks ago. Since then I have eaten at this place twice more, not so much because I fell in love with it right away, but more because I felt like I had to try three different sauces in order to give this place a fair review. The place itself is adorable, as you can tell from the photos it has three tall wooden chairs in front of it which are usually taken. Once you enter it, the place is really narrow and you stand by a counter, usually in a somewhat long line, where you order from. There are two tables in the back which fit about 4-5 people each and a bar which could fit about as many. The wooden tables have holes in them that are meant for the cones, I think that is both cute and a brilliant idea. The service is pretty quick and efficient and I would say for the amount of fries you get that they are not overpriced. Also, they do not have a bathroom that is available for customers from what I could tell. First time I came here I ordered the Frites sauce because it just seemed appropriate. I didn't plan for this to be my full meal, more like a ""snack"" so I shared the regular size with another person and for a ""snack"" it was really filling. The fries themselves were thick, mostly soft yet crunchy at times. They were not too salty which was good they actually had just the right amount of salt, however I cant say they were extraordinary. The sauce on the other hand was pretty good. My second time here I tried the Sweet Mango Chutney Mayo with my friend and I absolutely loved this sauce, you can barely taste the mayo and the sweetness is really subtle, definitely recommended for people who are not much of mayo fans. Third time I decided that these regular sized frites are going to be my actual lunch and for the most part I had them all to myself. The result was that I could not finish them, when combined with the sauce it is pretty filling. That time I tried the Roasted Garlic Mayo which I had my eye on for some time but unfortunately it was a disappointment, I cant put my finger on what exactly I didn't like about it, but at some point I just gave up on the sauce and ate those fries with ketchup. All in all, this place is worth a visit if only to try as many different sauces as you can handle, but if you come here expecting to try fries that will blow your mind, I suggest lowering your expectations or looking for another place. I personally will be back.",7,6,8,5
880,39496,780,9/11/12,"Waited to write this review because every time I thought of this place, my mouth begins to water. My cousins and I had just finished eating brunch, got some cannellonis from Little Italy, got some boba and ice cream in Chinatown.......and then decided to come here to eat. Yeah I know, we're pigs. I just couldn't bear the thought of passing this place up to try! The waiters must have thought we were the cheapest Asians ever. We were a party of 6 but got 2 bowls of noodles:  The Roast Duck Noodles and The BBQ Pork Noodles with Won Tons. We were so full from everything else and needed to leave room for dinner after this meal too.... Take a look and see the vibrant, thick cut, juicy meat in the bowls of noodles: Roast Duck Noodles: yelp.com/biz_photos/big-‚Ä¶ They're definitely not stingy on the meat portions here. The roast duck was nice and salty. It tasted even better when the duck was soaking in their juicy broth! My favorite part of the duck is the thigh. OmFg that piece of meat was so tender. BBQ Pork Noodles with Won Tons: yelp.com/user_local_phot‚Ä¶ BBQ Pork is one of my favorite things to eat because it is so sweet and pink in color. There was tons of meat in this little bowl to go around for all of us to have too! You could tell they make their own won tons as well. Extra brownie points! Some places I have been too, actually buy frozen ones and just feed them to you. I am sure these were frozen, but my point is they actually roll the won tons up themselves! The noodles in both bowls were average, but the meat and the broth were so tasty, it surpassed the need for better noodles. My cousin also told me that they have deals here occasionally for lobsters! 2 for $20? Awesome! I wish I had more days to come back and eat here because their rice dishes also looked salivating! I must mention, the food is REALLY cheap here. #authenticchinesefood #bomb #iloveNYC",7,8,7,8

This is the real deal as the get clientele that is from the middle east, India and surrounding areas.

And the soup inside is not as flavorful as DTF's. This place provides a tong to help you remove the dumplings, but I just end up puncturing the darn thing. Better off using your chopsticks. We also ordered some noodles (forget the name of the dish). It was like as if it was going through an identity crisis... it's semi stir fry noodles but as the same time it was sitting in soup....

While some are good (lamb ragu and mushroom sauce) some others (pesto and grandma's ragu) are bland. Sometimes fresh pepper or cheese would have helped but it's offered inconsistently. (Actually only once was fresh ground pepper offered). They also seem a bit too conservative with the salt. 3.I love the crostini they offer. White bean, pecorino and garlic and caponata are my favorites.I do wish instead of one large piece of bread the offered 2 or 3 smaller pieces. It's easier to share and easier to eat.

While I haven't paid it a visit since the new executive chef and pastry chef have taken residence (May 2014 from my understanding), I can speak to its fare under the former chef and pastry chef. In one word, extraordinary. The menu is delicately crafted, seasonal and local. The food is by far some of the best I've ever had (and I've had many 5-star, wonderful meals). Don't be afraid to ask questions about what will be on your plate. The staff are well-educated and willing to answer questions. A few menu stand-outs: the pork stick rolls, duck fat fries, lamb burger (lunch) and pickled eggs. We once had the BURGER for dinner, which was a special. It was honestly the best burger I've ever had; I wish it was a menu staple (hint hint, powers that be). Check out the Sunday Supper menu, too. This three-course meal for $27 is a steal. And don't be shy during lunch hours - I think some of their better food is served during that time, including a usually insane pastry on the counter. Save some room! The dining room is cozy, to say it kindly. Sometimes things are tight, especially during busy nights and holidays. But one simply can't fault Northern Spy a single star for its square feet. Plus the staff and hostess (Alyssa/Alissa - however you spell it) are warm, wonderful and top-notch. If I could eat three meals a day here, I would.

Nice decor, pretty people, and lots of locals -- not just trucked in ""foodie"" adventurers (Roberta's anyone?). This is all good. Unfortunately almost every visit here has been marred by mediocre or poor service. At the most recent brunch-time meal, there were two servers (two!) in a restaurant + patio packed full of people. We waited 10-15 minutes to even get a glance. Waitress was nice if scattered, and food came in reasonable time, but then as far as ""service"" went that was it. Not a single pass by to see how we were or to refill our empty water bottle or drinks. It seemed like they were short at least a body that day, as evidenced by the confused patter between the two overworked servers. So I don't blame them, not totally anyway. At least they got the orders right, which hasn't always been the case there. The music was the other issue. I suppose I can legitimately say I'm getting older, but regardless, the band was WAY too loud for brunch. Not that the music was bad. It was a tight trio. But there were older folks, families etc. and I noticed at times no one was even talking because it was impossible to do so. It seemed the band believed this was an 11 a.m. concert, rather than a chance to play accompaniment to peoples' meals and conversations. Lastly food, a bit pricey and middling to good. My ribeye hash was too little for $12, and seemed like yesterday's repurposed BBQ. Maybe that's what hash is supposed to be, but maybe it shouldn't actually taste like it? I dunno. Others had blackened catfish & shrimp po' boys. Better deals with big plates of salad and plenty of bread. The ""simple"" salad is the exact opposite with pecans, arugula, blue cheese and pickled onions -- probably my favorite aspect of the menu right there. Trio of sides was alright, with good spicy greens and creamy grits. Sweet potato fries needed some kind of sauce, and we ended up having to scramble to get ketchup.

After reading about this dish online we had high expectations and we were not disappointed. For our main course we had the tarragon chicken and charred beef.

You absolutely need a reservation if you want to come here, we always made ours days in advance. Carmine's is great for two people but better for parties. Meals are served family style (menu's are hung on the wall around the restaraunt), huge portions! Think two pounds of pasta (at least) in a huge mound on a platter (my mouth is watering).

Some of the items we ordered which stood out were: Penne alla Vodka, Garlic Bread + Cheese, & Manicotti...

I went there for dinner the other night, and the food was good, not amazingly good, but it was pretty good. The drink selection is extensive which is nice. Only gripe would be that I ordered the black truffle fries and didn't like the fact that they tasted reheated. I told our waitress, she offered to get me more, but by that time I had already had enough. It would have been nice if she had removed it from the bill considering we ate no more than two fries, but nonetheless, we paid and were on our way.

The bartender tended to us very nicely. We sat on the back porch, which is one of those converted Brooklyn back yards, and sipped some great late summer brews.

Full marks to Danny Meyer for designing a very ""New York"" menu, complemented by an excellent selection of wines--take it from a wine expert and colleague, who was once my dining company.  Now here are items that I would gladly endorse: the arugula and squash salad, the mushroom risotto (the best risotto I have ever eaten), and the steamed veggie plate (love the asparagus).  My discerning companions loved the grouper and halibut.  Five stars for the wine selection and dessert options.  The Apricot Pistachio Frangipani Tart--a masterpiece that combines great texture with taste.  Or the Chocolate Coconut Tart.  Delightful combination.

926,17145,220,8/22/11,"First time I came here was on a saturday around 3pm. The place was packed and my party of 3 waited at least 15minutes for a seat but that was fine because the server acknowledged our presence and took down our name. I ordered the Black Sesame Creme Brulee and it was so good. It was too sweet which was exactly how I liked my desserts. There's also a scoop of black sesame ice cream on top and a black sesame cracker/wafer on top of that. Service was quick and nice. Now for the second time. I came back today (monday) around 3pm and the place was almost full. Even though it wasn't as busy as saturday it took awhile for the server to even realize I was standing there. After me and my bf sat down it took a long time for them to get the order, for us to receive our food, for our dessert to come, and for our tea to be refilled. They didn't even give us the lunch menu. Food: We both ordered the Cha-Koga meal ($22) which comes with soymilk quiche w/ mushrooms and scallions, the day's soup, two side dishes, tea smoked salmon, rice, chef's dessert, and your choice of tea (except for matcha, tieguanyin, and dong ding oolong tea). Soymilk quiche was my favorite dish out of this meal other than the dessert. The texture was very smooth and even though this is a tea-house the specializes in tea and desserts, this was a very well executed dish. Two side dishes was sauteed vegetables and an octopus and long bean salad. Didn't think much of the vegetables but the octopus salad was decent. I liked the peanut sauce that it was mixed with. Unlike other peanut sauces this wasn't very sweet at all which complimented the octopus. Today's soup was a vegetable miso soup which tasted like a non-spicy version of a chinese soup called ""law song tong"" in cantonese. Tea smoked salmon wasn't what I expected and the sauce they put on top of it was very strong tasting. I don't think it paired well with the salmon. For dessert I got the sakura flan. I'm craving this right now! The texture is so much smoother than latin american flan. It had a mildly sweet taste that won't make you feel like you have to jog a mile to work off what you ate. I wanted to order this last time but it was sold out (which must mean it's very good) so thankfully I got to try it this time.",7,3,7,3

Now, I enjoy waffles (wafels) and, moreover, I adore things (dinges), so I had to give them a try. Some of the items on their menu were out of season, so I did have a bit of trouble ordering at first. I eventually just ordered off of the daily specials menu and got the Big Boy (pulled pork with BBQ sauce and cole slaw). The waffle was crispy and chewy, the pulled pork was tender, and the flavorful BBQ sauce pulled it all together. I was a little dismayed at the amount of cole slaw (it went right on the waffle) since I usually stay far away from the stuff, but I tried a little bit and, even for a cole slaw naysayer, I had to admit that it was pretty good. I must come back and try a sweet waffle sometime; that spekuloos stuff sounds crazy good. Wafels and dinges for the win-ges! Update:  Yes, I finally tried the spekuloos and yes, it was awesome. I actually enjoyed it more once it cooled a little-- it took on a more pleasing consistency that way. Tastes like a liquid ginger snap cookie!",9,8,9,8

There was no wait for a party of 4 on a Tuesday night, which was awesome considering the ridiculousness that often accompanies Ippudo East. But it was probably an artifact of being just opened and on a Tuesday night. The menu here is a bit different than Ippudo East. It focuses much more on appetizers and only has 3 choices of ramen. I decided to skip over the pork buns, and get some of the new appetizers that this location was offering. The appetizer we got, the Pork Tendan (or something like that), kind of looked like sausages over ramen. But the end result was pretty good. The ramen choices include the ever-popular Akamura-modern, but they also had the Karaka ramen that I don't remember appearing in Ippudo East. I opted for that, and it was delicious. There was a slight spice to it that really enhanced the flavor. Brooklyn Brewery has also been brewing a special ""Kaedama"" ale for Ippudo that I decided to try. I can't say much more than that it tasted like a solid ale as I am more of a stout/porter person myself. Definitely enjoyed my experience at Ippudo West, and would come back.

A friend of mine was able to help me out with dinner reservations and my boyfriend and I celebrated our August anniversary here.  We started with the house made ricotta, fig compote and grilled bread and it was delicious.  It was a little on the sweet side for my personal taste but my boyfriend devoured whatever I was unable to finish.  For my main meal I chose the ricotta ravioli (because one can never eat enough ricotta cheese)  and it was BY FAR the best tasting pasta I have ever eaten in my entire life (and I have eaten in Italy).  There is such a freshness to the food here that helped me to understand why it is difficult to get a table.  However, the place wasn't packed at all.  We were there at 6:30PM after a Broadway show and there were tons of available tables around us.  I think ABC Kitchen might limit the amount of reservations that are booked in advance so that they can still honor walk ins, which is very smart.  If you intend to eat an early dinner on a Saturday night you shouldn't have an issue getting a table with a minimal wait.   The service was excellent.  Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly and asked us if we were celebrating anything special after we ordered champagne.   We told her we were celebrating our anniversary and when we finished our meals she brought out a congratulatory pastry dish with candles.

They use 2 types of rum and housemade ginger beer. Also enjoyed a good burger (grass fed, pretty tasty, prepared perfectly at med rare to medium. Fries were a bit too salty, overpowered the otherwise decent fries. Price wise: little expensive, more than most other spots in Greenpoint. But worth it for the ambiance, service. Lots of little touches that make it really pleasant (if you care about those things): like the little white tiles they use on the walls that match the tiles on the interesting beer tap, stools are comfy and fit the mood (also white), lighting fixtures and iPads for inputting orders are in dark wood, all appear custom made.

We originally planned on going to the Pio Pio on 34th street on the east side, but we found out that this one was closer, so we walked on over, and let me tell you, it was a good thing we walked because we ate SO MUCH FOOD.  We ordered two of the Matador Combos for the 6 of us to share. We ate every bit, too!  The chicken was delicious, we loved the little hot dogs that came in the combo, and the rice and beans were amazing, too.  A few of us ordered sangria, too, and that was great.  If you're going to get some, try to get a pitcher to share, since it'll come out costing less. Three of us shared a half pitcher ($15), which gave each of a glass.  So it was only $5 for each, where getting an individual glass is $8.  A few of my friends got dessert, too. They got the Peruvian chocolate cake, which was very rich, and the Tres Leche cake, which was so delicious.  I left with my pants feeling a lot tighter and I was glad to walk home to help digest.

The tables outside are really close together and you can hear each other's conversation very clearly.   On to the food, the bread they gave you was good, they provided a tomato sauce with olives for dipping the bread.  On to the food, they have various types of pasta and risotto and they have specials for the day. So I decided to try gnocci with shrimp, zucchini in a tomato sauce.  The gnocci tasted like rice cake, the zucchini was cut into very tiny pieces and the shrimp tasted good, very crisp tasting.  They were not cheap on the shrimp but the plates seem a bit small, based on the fact that i think many non asian plates are too small.  The plates were chipped on the sides, not sure if this was on purpose.   Service was okay, seemed a little crazy with what seems to be one server.  Looks like she was going in and out all the time.

I was in the area with a friend looking for something new that neither of us have yet tried so we looked on OpenTable and found David Burke fabrick. Perfect, we thought this is the best time to try it out. We get there and are seated in a fairly nice yet a bit awkward floor setup - you feel like you are in the lobby bar. Staff are all very friendly, service is attentive although I don't think they do a good job in steering you the right direction with the food order. When we asked our waiter for recommendations, he literally listed most every item on the menu. Thanks dude, great help. We end up getting the following: 1) Avocado Panna Cotta - Very bland with stale plantain chips. I see other Yelpers like it, but I definitely didn't. 2) Oysters - They are good if you are in the mood for them. Nothing special though. 3) Burrata Salad - This was excellent and very refreshing with the watermelon. 4) Roasted Mushroom Flatbread - This was also very good, literally a mushroom on pizza bread dish. Not too big of a portion but might get you a bit full for the heavier portions. 5) Candied Bacon - Cool presentation and apparently on of their marquee dishes but it's just bacon with maple sauce on it. I think this is one of those cool party dishes but there isn't much to it. 6) Whole Roasted Chicken - This was a very good dish because of the chicken/cavatelli (pasta) combo. I wish the cavatelli wasn't so salty but it had a very good flavor to it, as did the chicken. 7) Burke Cheesecake Stick Tree - Ripoff. Stay away from this dessert. Presentation is ridiculous with a limp weak tree and cake pops you can buy for a dollar at Starbucks. The ones at David Burke fabrick don't even taste that good either. So all in all with the many great restaurants in the area with a similar price range, I do not at all recommend this restaurant to make the trip out to. Might as well do a tasting menu at a Michelin starred restaurant for the same price as what we had above. The flavor of the food was just OK, and although the service is attentive and friendly, they are just awful at being helpful.

We had to wait about 25 minutes for a table.  On a nice day, you could wait outside, but given the monsoon, we opted to wait inside.  I noticed it was a lot easier to seat parties of 2, as those tables cleared up faster and more were available.   We were seated at a cozy table in the back.  I ordered the large latte to start, my friend ordered the large mocha.  Both were very good - way better than starbucks (but then again, what isn't these days).  My latte was super foamy, which I love.  It was good to the last drop. For our brunch entrees, we all ordered crepes.  I ordered the crema de marrons (?) which is chestnut jam with cream fraiche on the side.  The cream fraiche was an odd addition - it was kinda sour-cream like and didn't seem to go all that well with the chestnut flavor.  Although I strayed from my normal chocolate and banana crepe, I was pleased.  The flavor was unique - and I have not tried or seen chestnuts on a crepe menu before!  One friend ordered the lemon crepe and another ordered the fruit crepe with strawberry sauce.  In order of preference, I liked Lemon first, then Chestnut, and last the fruit crepe.  The strawberry sauce didn't taste very fresh, and the fruit were kind of mushy.   For 3 crepes and 2 coffee drinks, the total for each person was bout $10 - not bad! I was impressed with the selection on the menu - tons of savory crepes, salads, and other standard brunch fare, such as omlettes and french toast.  It looked like a pretty good drink menu as well.  The restaurant is pretty tiny - good for small groups of people (parties of 2-4).  Could be a good date spot too.     I would certainly go back - what's more - Billy's Cupcakes is across the street, in case you need more sugar to start your day :)",7,8,8,8
944,3475,410,11/19/08,"If you're reading this on a Tuesday between 1-8 pm, get off the laptop and go over to this place for half-price tapas and cheap amazing sangria! You'll be back, and I hope to see you there. We had a few tapas, with the arepa con carne and the empanada trio being highlights. The meat was succulent, fork-tender, and spicy sweet all at the same time; SO good! The salmon ceviche was reminiscent of gazpacho, with a rich spicy tomato taste. Made me think of the kind of comfort food I wish I could have whenever I need comforting! And let me just say again that the sangria was excellent. I am very picky about my sangria, and this version had a full-bodied mouthfeel from the liquor and sugar, plenty of spice and acidity from the wine, and really stood up to the vibrant flavors of the food. It was pretty loud inside, as others have noted, so it's probably not the best place for a romantic evening. But if all you want to do is chow down on generous portions of tasty food and drink amazing sangria for not much money, who needs to talk all night anyway? Just look into each other's eyes and know that you're both thinking ""Who gets the last bite? I hope it's me.""",7,7,6,8

I also like the fact that some of the side dishes rotate daily, so I get to try new things if I'm feeling adventurous. As I said, everything I tried here is generally good. The service, however, blows. The cashier girls at the register are just rude and unpleasant. I sometimes ask myself why I spend so much money at this place, when there isn't really a slightest indication that they want my business. Also, if you ask for any kind of modification to your sandwich, it causes obscene amounts of confusion. Five stars for food. 1.5 stars for service.",5,6,6,7

The host was very gracious and personable, and our waitress was knowledgeable not only of the menu, but also wine pairings, of which we took full advantage. My wife and I split the meatball sliders - they were a perfect appetizer to split or share (3 on the plate - who gets the last one!?) I had the steak, which was perfect, and we also had roasted asparagus and brussels sprouts - also excellent, but a tad buttery. Finished with the chocolate mousse and would have licked the china if my wife had let me. Many of the tables around us were trying to eat and run to evening theater shows, and the kitchen and wait staff, clearly pros at this game, helped them get their food in plenty of time to enjoy it and make their curtain.

We opted for this restuarant because all of the reviews raved about the food, but they all said it wasn't crowded.  These things were all true.  The food was great.  We made a reservation on Open Table and asked for a table by the big fish tank and it was waiting when we got there.  They gave us a complimentary glass of champagne for our anniversary as well as an after dinner drink.  The scallops over the pork belly was perfectly done.  We also got the lamb chops.

The space is beautiful, modern and elegant without seeming pretentious.  The staff is super friendly, everyone from the hostess to the guy who poured us water.  Great service all around. Appetizers:  Lamb Skewers accompanied by some lovely yogurt sauce and a  bean, cucumber, olive salad. High quality lamb, super tender and tasty.  Cod Croquettes, served with a creamy lemon pur√©e.  The croquettes were incredibly creamy and really good. The pur√©e on its own seemed pretty sweet, almost dessert like, but when paired with the croquettes it added a wonderful freshness to the dish. Entrees: Steak Frites served with fries and a watercress salad.  The skirt steak was pretty perfect, wonderful flavor with the right amount of char. The watercress with horseradish was the perfect accompaniment.  The fries were a little too salty, but cooked well and the aioli dipping sauce was great.  The pork chop over brussels sprout-apple hash and parsnip pur√©e was delicious.  I've never had a pork chop so tender and juicy and the hash went wonderfully with it.  The parsnip pur√©e was very tasty, but I wish there was more of it. Dessert:  Apple Crisp with dried cherries and creme anglaise was heavenly, really some of the best I've ever had.  The molten chocolate cake with salted caramel and espresso ice cream was also very good. Service:  As mentioned above the staff was very friendly and they were just as accommodating.  The meal went at just the right pace, we were never left waiting for anything but at the same time we did not feel rushed. A solid meal + a beautiful space = a great evening.",8,7,8,7

955,9751,306,9/17/13,"A girlfriend of mine was visiting from out of town and selected Obao as the venue for her reunion dinner. I have to say, I had my doubts as I walked down 9th Ave, because of the location... but I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. Obao's interior is trendy for a Thai restaurant, and does not reflect the price point of their menu items. (I would have expected it to be more expensive.) As I was led upstairs, I was even more surprised because it was the perfect setup for hosting an intimate dinner party. We had about 16 people in our group, and there was another large party on the other side of the room. Everyone enjoyed themselves and there were no hiccups in service or food. And seriously, the food was great. The drunken noodles were the best I've ever had - it wasn't greasy and I finished my entire plate. My favorite part? The pleasant surprise of paying less than I expected when I received my bill. Would totally come back again. A great place for a casual date night or gathering with close friends. The only drawback that I can think of is that Obao is out of the way for me, but for good Thai food at a very fair price, add to that the trendy decor and cozy ambiance, I would definitely return! Obao is definitely a cut above your average Thai restaurant, and yet it still maintains that no-frills vibe that makes me such a big fan of this place.

So we gave it a shot. It's very comfortable, the decor is beautiful, the atmosphere feels perfect for a cozy chic eastern themed restaurant. The restroom is big and clean and very pretty!

While my personal favorite time to visit Sweet Afton is the late afternoon, when you can almost have the place to yourself, I'm happy to be there even when I can't get a table or seat. The patrons there, even on the busiest weekend nights, I can totally tolerate - and NO TVs!! What a blessing! The thing that brought me back the first few times was the relatively small but still ecstasy-inducing beer selection. I'm admittedly a MAJOR beer snob, and tend to hate 90% of a given bar's beer selection.. But I have to say: every beer they've chosen for their tap/cask selection has a purpose - to expose the true deliciousness of New York State microbrews. And they rotate their beer selection just enough to thrill me when it's been a few days and I come back to discover a new delightful cask beer (ie: Bengali Tiger or Languanita's Cappuchino Stout). Another element that makes Sweet Afton my go-to neighborhood spot is the super-friendly staff. They really seem to care about continuing to provide people with the pleasant, mindful service that'll make patrons come back time and time again. In closing: the beer I love, a bar crowd I don't hate, and HAND-CUT FRIES that will put my heart into utmost contentedness - I couldn't be luckier to live three blocks from this wonder.

Say ""everything"" if you want all the standard toppings. Actually, just say ""everything."" The bf and I stopped by to try a few of their tacos, including the carne asada and adobada. The adobada is very much like al pastor, roasted slowly on a spit almost like schawarma. They actually stick a large pineapple atop the huge hunk of pork, so that the sweet juices flow down slowly to infuse all its flavor on the pork and creates a beautiful lacquer. The adobada actually reminds me of the al pastor from Leo's Taco Truck in LA - which is a very good thing. The corn tortillas (and you should always get corn, although they do offer flour) were amazing as well, perfectly pliable, toothsome and incredibly fresh. The filling to tortilla ration was spot-on, making for perfect flavor and textural proportions with every bite. The bf also enjoyed the carne asada taco immensely, commenting that they're probably among the best tacos he's ever had. Mind you he is from San Diego.

986,7832,544,9/19/13,"A very small, intimate spot dimly lit by quartz candles, lanterns, and chandeliers, Sofia Wine Bar & Cafe is romantic and relaxing, yet simple when it comes to Italian wine bars. A solid midtown East after-work locale and/or a great backdrop for a date. With regards to dates though, I see it being better for late-night. The noise level and crowd intensity at peak hours is simply not conducive to deep conversation. A bar to consider if in the mood for some serious wine indulgence. Waiters will immediately greet you upon entrance. The service here is generally friendly. You can sit either at the bar or one of their wooden tables set up by candles. Sofia offers a variety of straightforward choices, so it takes out a lot of guesswork. Their menu highlight would be their mid-sized thin-crust pizzas with optional toppings of prosciutto, mozzarella, and meatballs, etc. They also offer a selection of appetizers. My partner and I went with the Spinach Artichoke Dip and Meat & Cheese Platter accompanied by glasses of wine. Selection of wine is quite wonderful yet also rather steep, ranging from $12-$18 a glass. Bottles range $50 and above. The Spinach Artichoke Dip, served with blue tortilla corn chips, was an enjoyable sharing plate. Sufficient chunks of artichoke is swirled in oozing, thick layers of spinach and cheese. They also supply a side of sourdough bread. The Meat & Cheese platter was a tasty assortment of prosciutto, sopressata, and cheese. The two appetizers were perfect for sharing and paired great with the wine. A slight drawback would be the lack of a description for what we were having. We'd ask the waiter, but it was simply too noisy in the bar at the time. Overall, Sofia offers a classy ambiance for a very uncomplicated, relaxing dinner. With an extensive Italian wine list, you cannot go wrong when in the mood for some quality wine.",8,3,8,3

Her knowledge was impressive and what she recommended was incredible. I love charteuse so she got me a drink that wasn't on the menu. It was so tasty! Then we got the tasting menu, which was unbelievable. Each dish was the perfect size and had a unique flavourful taste. I can't think of what plate I liked the most... The best was the dessert though.... If that is even possible. It was malt ice cream with pretzel and chocolate combination and I can't get the texture and taste out of my mind.

Also would add that the sushi rice here reminded me a bit of the sushi places I used to frequent in Tokyo, i.e., it's done right. I loved that I could taste each grain of rice. I realized when I got the bill that yes, this place IS expensive. My bf and I got 26 pieces, miso soup, green tea, and an yebisu for lunch today and the bill came out to $190 with tip and tax... and honestly, we were still a bit hungry. P.S.

Unfortunately, we were sorely mistaken, for even in Brooklyn, it is impossible to beat the dreaded Saturday brunch crowd. In between sips of sweet tea and bites of buttered biscuits, the deep fried chicken hit the spot. Hot out the kitchen, we wasted no time worrying about the sodium and oil content, letting the sweet juices dribble down our chin as we bit into the perfectly crisped chicken. The batter is a delicate balance of sugary and salty, a tantalizing prelude to the meat which was cooked to just the right amount of tenderness. If you are willing to brave the throngs of hipster and endure the awful service atypical to Williamsburg, you will be rewarded with the greasiest, most juicy fried chicken your money can buy.",7,4,8,5

My friend happen to buy a ramen colander that day.  He took it out of his bag and showed the kitchen.  One of the cooks looked a little alarmed and gave us a stare.   My friend likes attention, what can I say.   I went for the pork broth with the thick noodles.  The spicy miso broth looked good but I want to see how they do a basic bowl of noodles first.   I did notice that the pork was torched before serving as it is probably pre-cooked and cold. Pretty simple operation in making the noodles.    It was pretty much what I was expecting but was hoping the pork broth would be a little richer.    I felt sorry for the one waitress who was practically doing everything except cooking the food. The daikon salad with sesame sauce is pretty basic. Overall not bad for the price and less fufu than going to Ippudo.",6,3,7,4

This way if it's your first time here and you want to try a bit of everything, you can. Their rice is different than the rice they offer at most chicken and rice carts around NY. It's much better. Pita bread and salad always come with your meal for free. The white sauce is Mmmmm MMMM good. The red sauce def. has a good kick to it. I love spicy foods, so this is right up my alley. One should try it out first before deciding to dump the whole red sauce onto their meal. One of these bad boys serve as 2, sometimes 3 meals for me. You will def. get your moneys worth here. If you don't want leftovers, share this with someone. Or if you have a big appetite, then 1 would suffice. The service is fast, which is good because the line is ALWAYS long.

It wasn't that busy when I came but I can just imagine a line of semi-drunk people going down the street at midnight. The menu is confusing. It shouldn't be since it's really only fries and sauces. But for a first timer, I felt lost. What's the difference between on the side and on the fries? And if you get more than one sauce, do they layer it both on the fries - on multiple layers? I just made it easier and got the sauce on the side - though it was more expensive than just getting it on the fries. The regular size is still huge. I thought it was one of those paper cones - turns out it was two put together. I think it feeds three (girls). How do people enjoy without sitting down at a table? We tried standing and eating it outside but it was messy. And they have like 3 tables inside. So lots of people got it to go. Where do you guys go to eat it? I assume it takes too long to subway back to wherever you came from and fries are best enjoyed hot. So this was more of a snack before dinner. The fires were hot - I saw them making it when I ordered. And so they felt really fresh and it wasn't too oily which I liked. It's in between the skinny and steak fries which is good. And just great potato taste. Stuck with the most popular sauces it seemed - the mango chutney mayo and the rosemary garlic mayo. I preferred the mango because the garlic was really overpowering on the other one. But yeah I liked - something different other than just ketchup.

How about serving a decent amount to begin with? I have been going to Heidi's since it opened, and I think Cipi's food is top-notch, and the service often is too, which have made up for the cramped surroundings and too-off-the- beaten-path location.

The perfect banh mi would leave you inexplicably wanting more. Although Banh Mi Saigon's banh mi is not the worse I've had, it's definitely not the greatest. The location was very accessible and the wait during weekday lunch hour was surprisingly bearable. While ordering two of the #4 Vietnamese ham and p√¢t√© ($4.50) to go, I eagerly anticipated the light yet crispy texture of the french baguette in harmonious with the ham and p√¢t√© I was so spoiled with as a child, but soon realized that reality was far from what I had hoped for. The baguette was disappointingly stale and the p√¢t√© was mediocre. The Vietnamese ham a.k.a cha lua was sub-par. It definitely did not taste any different from your everyday typical store brought ham. The pickled daikon and carrots were on the sweeter side with an overwhelmingly bitter aftertaste. Strange would be a total understatement. The combination of the banh mi had left me sick to my stomach. Not even a cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee) can relinquish my awful banh mi experience. I would recommend mastering the art of creating the perfect banh mi at home or for the sake of convenience, have your significant other master it for you!

Now, the new place just seems to have lost so much of that home feel & more importantly, FLAVOR. The service was on the slow end.  The hummus was blah (too much tahini), the kafta was dry but at least the chicken shawarma was good.

I ordered their 'filet of bao' and 'smoked chicken taco' specials.  Their taco was filled with barely any meat - it was largely cartilage and convective tissue which cannot be eaten.  Their fish bao was served RAW. Like, they beaded it and briefly fried the outside,  but the fish on the inside was cold and uncooked.  Keep in mind - this is not sushi.  It is not safe to serve this type of fish raw.  It is not sushi-grade and not supposed to be raw.  While it was nice to hear the head chef screaming at his line cook for leaving it raw,  that didn't help my subsequent food poisoning.

We're greeted by a very friendly host who pulls out the table for my date, compliments her dress, seats us, and promptly gives us water and menus.   The waiter comes over, informs us of unlimited brunch cocktails, and gives us the specials.  Ummm, did you say unlimited cocktails?  Bring it!  I tried all 4 of their cocktail specials, and while a couple were a little sweet for my liking, they certainly helped change my outlook of the afternoon.   My date and I order: 1. Tres Arepas - short ribs, pork belly and chicken deliciousness.  Very well done! 2. Sandwich Cubano - this ain't your over-the-counter Cubano.  Their version is really delicious and awesome! 3. Ceviche Limeno - not the best, but well done and I would definitely eat it again.   The interior of the place is nice, vibey and sophisticated without being stuffy.

I'm not exactly sure why, maybe because I was dating this girl for awhile at the time, but I decided to drink as many of their cocktails as possible.  I even asked for more booze in the sweet cocktail, but my waiter told me it was pre-mixed and not possible.  When the brunch special was ending, I asked for two more drinks to round out the afternoon.  He obliged my request with a look of surprise and no attitude.

I thought it was quite good but I tried a piece of my father's capretto- that was three times better! Instead of dessert I had grappa.... if you like sweet grappa I would highly recommend their cherry and almond grappa- delicious!,9,8,8,7
1033,40982,134,10/16/06,"Ok, the chef here was too much!!  We got the total lecture on how this was real sushi and not ""fake"" sushi and ergo no rolls that you find at other places.  It was good, don't get me wrong but sheesh a little less 'tude dude!  We actually got in late and they closed shop early.  We then went to McD's and got burgers.  We were still hungry!",4,7,5,8
1034,46442,808,4/9/14,"This review is for brunch.  Drinks are good (and the bottomless brunch special is great, but short -- $15 for 1 hour of unlimited refills), food is good, service was fine.  My only complaint is the cramped space, which I guess can't be helped in NYC and especially in the E. Village.   This was my first time at this location, though I've been to the Perry Street location several times (here's my review for that location: yelp.com/biz/yerba-buena‚Ä¶).  At this location, they do not have my guava pisco drink, which I can drink pitchers of all by my lonesome, so I settled for the mango margarita, which was good, but strong/sour.  I eventually switched to some sort of mimosa.  Obviously, after making the rookie mistake of mixing alcohols, I left with a banging headache, but honestly, I can't complain.  I def got my money's worth. To eat, we started with the guacamole, which is delicious, but be warned that the portion is not substantial, and splitting it between three people wasn't really ideal, but it was a nice way to begin the meal.  Two of us got the burger, which was excellent, and another friend got the fish tacos, which were really good, but the portion was SO TINY.  It was almost like a kid's meal or a side dish, and he's a big guy with a big appetite, so needless to say he wasn't satisfied.  For dessert, we got the french toast.  If you like the combination of sweet and salty, the french toast is absolutely perfect!  The combination of manchego cheese and dulce de leche is genius!  Not sure why I hadn't thought of it before!  ;-)   Even though this location was fine, the E. Village is a pain to get to considering that I live all the way uptown.  I'm not sure that it would be worth the trip to go all the way back down there for YB when I can just go to the Perry Street location, which is convenient to about a million trains.  If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll definitely be back.",6,6,4,5

1045,14478,795,5/20/13,"This place gets major props for the funny bartenders who made our night extra fun.  I wish they would offer the ricotta cheese dish with just the cheese - I'm a much bigger fan of the free bread offered than the bread that came with the cheese.  I think I'm going through a major carb phase because the past few supposedly great restaurants I've been to, I found myself enjoying the bread way more than the dishes I'm paying for. I like the kale salad a lot, despite it being doused in way too much cheese, and my pasta - the chitarra with red shrimp was pretty good.  They definitely skimped on the shrimp though, which is kind of embarrassing I think for such a nice establishment. The rabbit was too lightly seasoned and not very exciting. Great bathrooms - large, with a sitting area and three stalls. I can't say how much I appreciate restaurants that actually take care to make sure all their facilities are comfortably pleasant for their customers.",7,6,6,5

I was a little uncertain of where exactly I was supposed to go at first but the place isn't very big or difficult to figure out; On the back wall is their hot food (rotisserie chicken, meatloaf, roasted broccoli, etc). They also have a build-your-own-bowl station and a case of (cold?) food for purchase by the pound (meatballs, chicken tenders, fish sticks). I probably would have preferred some of the food in this case but was unsure if that was only take-home-and-heat-up food or if the staff could heat it for you. I got the 1/4 rotisserie chicken, roasted sweet potatoes and roasted broccoli. All was what I expected, but it's just so nice to go out and not worry about ingredients!

1054,29444,251,6/18/12,"For those of us with Asian mothers that can cook, it seems silly listening to people go on about the miraculous deliciousness of pork buns like they were just recently invented in the East Village. If anybody invented pork buns, it was my thousand-year-old mom, and hers are way better. The duck on rice proved to be another stumbling block at Momofuku. Less flavorful than the ducks one can find at any old place in nearby Chinatown, it was sliced too thinly to do the texture of the meat or skin any justice. I think the perfect way to encapsulate Momofuku is: meticulously prepared Asian food that tastes like a non-Asian made it. They should put that on their menus. Regardless of my opinion, Momofuku's reputation, and that of its celebrity chef-owner David Chang, precedes itself. His ""bad-boy"" persona is supposedly substantiated by the fact that he doesn't provide vegetarian options. In terms of things to be intimidated by, I think the prices are much, much scarier.",2,5,1,6

We decided to share appetizers and get our own entrees. For apps, we split: -the roasted escargot -sauteed baby octopus -classic mussels My favorite of these three was the escargot. So buttery. Yum! The octopus was okay (still dreaming of the octopus at Toqueville) and the mussels were nothing special. We had to dig through them to get to the sauce at the bottom. The bread was plentiful though and we kept asking for more and more to soak of all the sauces from our various appetizers. For entrees, three of us got the Filet Mignon with foie gras and my boyfriend got the garlic duck confit. The Filet was absolutely delish! The foie gras was the perfect accompaniment and the truffle sauce was divine. My boyfriend didn't love his dish--the menu did warn how rich it would be and it was right. Too rich. The veggie sides were all fresh and very good. For dessert, I got a cappuccino we all shared the chocolate lava cake, the banana creme brulee and the meringue. Nothing stood out to me, but my friends enjoyed. The ambiance was decent...it is a little cramped. Service was good.

The cod w pistachio sauce was the size of half my palm, two bites!  The beet salad was very thinly sliced beets with arugula. It was very good.  The not so great part is the fact we had to wait an hour past our reservation time and the very long recitation of the specials which was a little pretentious. It you have about 35 specials, why not just put it in print? And lastly, I ordered a glass of wine , no bottle cause my dinner mates don't drink. Well the glass was filled about 1/4 of the glass. That seemed miserly. It wasn't like I ordered some vintage wine, just a glass of house Pinot Grigio.  My meal came to $75 which is a little high for what I got.

1067,141172,768,6/10/11,"O.M.G. Visited Lobster Joint on Saturday shortly after arriving from San Francisco. What a great little ""joint"" this is!  Justin Ernsberger brings all his years of experience with seafood, most recently as chef of The Mermaid Inn EV to bear. Great, great menu thoughtfully crafted with all the best of a NE lobster shack in a really smart understated and polished operation in Green Point. It's designed as a quick service restaurant, so the generous open space that leads straight from the front door to the cash register under the large chalkboard menu to place your order. Get your number and grab a seat, inside or out, and your entire order is brought to you before you know it.  The bar has an equally thoughtful menu of special cocktails plus a great selection of beers. I had the excellent clam chowder that is rich without the weight, the incredible lobster roll and perfect fresh homemade slaw plus broccoli rabe. I really appreciate all the handcrafted counters, tables, and bar. You can tell a lot of love went into building Lobster Joint. It's enhanced by the rare antique Japanese glass buoys and other select antique fishing gear over the bar. The decorating makes a statement without being kitschy. It's obvious Lobster Joint wants their customers to be the focal points...in every way. It's a testament to the professionals who are behind Lobster Joint that the operation and service are already sooo smooth after only being open 10 days.

I made reservations Monday afternoon for 7:30 and when I showed up I was shocked at how packed the place was, especially for a Monday. At 7:31 we were seated at our table which made me very happy! My boyfriend and I started out with some delicious cocktails which were on the strong side, but there is nothing wrong with that in my book. We ordered a ton of food and I have ranked them in order from my favorite to not so favorite: 1. Grilled Shrimp and Chorizo Skewer (I would have ordered more they were that good) 2. P.E.I. Mussels (the bread that is used for dipping tops this dish off) 3. Seared Sea Scallops with Ham (the combination was out of this world) 4. Carpaccio of Beef (the horseradish is what really ties this dish together) 5. Crispy Brussels Sprouts (the apples are a great twist to this basic dish) 6. Seared Foie Gras (my portion was lacking mango ginger chutney which I think would have changed my ranking of this dish) 7. Bacon-wrapped Dates and Olives (classic dish that you really cant mess up, the olives were a great addition). Trust me, all of the food was AMAZING...but that is my personal raking of the dishes I tried. There is only one small reason why I gave Alta 4 and not 5 stars (and trust me if I could give 4.5 I would). I happened to be seated right next to the bus boy station where they would get clean knives and forks. Because the restaurant was so packed the bus boy kept throwing the forks and knives into their respected sections which was fine at first. But for 90 minutes I kept getting distracted by the sound of knives, forks and spoons clanking against one another. It started to drive me a little crazy. And that is why I did not give Alta a 5.

The tartare came with fried fish skin and it was delicious, the octopus was on point too, pretty much grilled to perfection! For the main course I opted for the fluke and my boyfriend had the duck pasta.  My fluke came with spaghetti squash and the duck pasta had a raw egg in it.  Again, both were fantastic. Overall, we had a really good time.  The service was great.  Definitely coming back again.",9,6,8,5

Well worth the wait as you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Seriously, it was a welcoming meal across the river after eating at mediocre places in Manhattan all weekend long.

The peppery meat lasagna was the high point for me, with dipping the delicious bread in the remaining sauce being a close second.  My wife spoke with the owner for some time and when she found out it was my birthday, she treated us with 4-5 Italian dessert pastries, which were each better than any that I had at any other point on the trip...and we were regulars at the Plaza Food Hall, which is great in its own right (for a price).  The owner is the sweetest lady and was literally calling out to us as we left wishing me a happy birthday.  Ignore reviews that claim she is anything but nice - those people must suck. I will absolutely be back.",9,8,8,7
1087,14931,662,8/25/12,"Salt & Fat. The very name of this establishment resonates in me... I've come here to delve into my hedonistic side where images of pork belly, sweets, dark chocolate, chilli peppers, steak, bacon fat, apple butter (flavor upon flavor) dance in my head ... and perhaps some salad and fresh fruit to cleanse the palette... or panna cotta... or ice cream. Whichever comes first. I was unsure of whether or not to write a review for this place. As a native Sunnysider, I've heard about this place before it even opened. People talked of a new ""5 star"" esq restaurant opening up in the area, giving Sunnyside another reason to be one of the best neighborhoods in the city; It's definitely one of the best foodie neighborhoods in New York. Having grown up here, I was happy to see this small Irish neighborhood flourish into a sophisticated, yet comfortable and residential hub, where people's eyes light up when you say the words, ""I live in Sunnyside."" That being said, as with most fine dining establishments, I wanted to wait a while until after the initial buzz... and then some more in order to ensure that the place was run well and that the food, service and reviews were consistent. I also searched for a reason to NOT stop by, simply because it was so well received in the press. For someone like myself who loves good food and fine dining, I simply had to wait until the words of praise died down and I could go in and sit in comfort. I waited a while... and the words of Salt & Fat praise still continued. I gave up. I had to try the food. The perfect dinner companion? A date who loves fine dining and food, who cooks at home, who is a mortgage banker and who spends the majority of his time in the Hamptons with the rest of his foodie friends and colleagues. I knew that he would be acute in his assessment along with my own. Flavor Hedonism (what we ordered): - Complimentary popcorn popped in bacon fat - Pork Belly Buns - Oxtail Terrine - Hangar steak w/ Salad - Scallops A glass of Sauvagnon Blanc Sigh. It was good... Actually, it was more than good. It was very good. The only dish that I was not truly happy about was the pork belly buns- but that's only because I absolutely love pork belly (It's comparable to my love for foie gras - which, btw, foie gras banned in California? Come on). The pork belly fat was similar to the Korean ""Pork Hock,"" which looks and tastes as if it is either blanched or boiled. I prefer the Chinese Clay pot versions of pork belly, in which the fat has been melted off and the meat is filled with flavor of whatever soy, salt or other spices/ sauces that it was marinated with. The Oxtail Terrine was excellent. No complaints. It was a little ""harder"" than what I expected, as terrine is supposed to be a little ""jellier"" - I'd describe a standard terrine as a meaty/ chunky foie gras. However it was definitely understood that it was supposed to be meatier and I appreciated that. The sauce that went with it was also delicious. Scallops: My companion felt that it was a little overdone. And it might have been well done- but definitely on the fresh side and not on the overdone rubbery side. The toasted corn was cute. It was a dish I could have made at home and perhaps a little too familiar to me. Hangar steak salad. Excellent. By the time the entree came, I was full. I ordered it ""very bloody"" and it came out rare as all hell. However, I liked that. Ate one or two slivers and was stuffed. I took the rest home, nuked it (sorry delicious meat- I had committed a food crime, but it was too good to just leave there) and ate it the next day with my meals. The chili lime sauce was sweet and tart and the fresh green chilies on top reminded me of my time farming and cooking in Hunan, China. Overall rating: 4 stars. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their pork trotter and fried chicken. Mmm.",7,6,6,5

That stated, our meal was not as special as his other restaurants and the service was lacking. I was with a food critic and the wait staff actually forgot a middle course we ordered and they had to rearrange things. Then the Sommelier, who I had heard raves about, brings over a wine which the server had recommended. It was a white, and when I looked at the color, it appeared to be turned. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt because surely she knows more than I and secondly, I had not had this relatively unusual white before. Well, it was indeed turned, which really made me wonder how the Sommelier could have attempted to serve it.  I understand if she did not know me, but the fact that I was with someone they did know and well, who writes for a major paper, was beyond me. That stated, many things were good and I feel that I just caught it on a night where many things went wrong with our table. And the company was great, so a lovely evening it was.",4,5,3,6

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere cozy and lively at the same time. Different ramen get brought out in different colored bowls. It's perfectly fine to share, especially the ramen is more pricey than it has the right to be. Although good for them, since they make food that people are willing to pay for.

With that being said, this is one of the few Malaysian joints in NYC with amazing and well spiced curry. The roti's curry dipping sauce was to die for. Perfect consistency, tolerable heat and wonderful flavors. Although the roti itself was not as crisp as I expected it to be, it did not take away from the dish itself. We also had the satay chicken. The peanut dipping sauce was a bit overly sweet, but the charred chicken was great, not too dry. Boyfriend thought that it was way too oily but I felt it was alright. We also shared the beef rendang and it was godly!!!! The meat was incredibly tender and the fuse of spices leaves an explosion of flavors in your palette. It was definitely on the spicier side, but with Malaysian cuisine, heat is a given! The portion was exceptionally big, but did not come with rice. Boo.. Enjoyed a soy bean with grass jelly drink and a red bean drink on the side. No complaints, def. give it a try. Also subdues the heat from the spiciness of the dishes.

1115,70914,333,6/22/14,"Overall:  2.5/5, this place is over-hyped. Being on that awful Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives show is NOT a good recommendation. As the brilliant Dave Holmes once said, Guy Fieri is a Troll doll made of spicy ranch dressing. Those with discerning palates should know to avoid anything he likes. Still, so many of you Yelpers love it, so we gave it a shot. I was really worried about all the reviews that talked about the long wait, because my mom is visiting and recently had foot surgery, so she can't stand for long periods of time. To avoid a wait, we arrived for brunch around 9:55 a.m. on Sunday, just before they opened, and we were seated in the first wave of tables, so that was great. By the time we finished up, there were about 25 people waiting outside. Good to know if you find yourself in a similar situation:  there's a bus stop with a bench just a stone's throw from the entrance of the restaurant, so if someone in your party really needs to sit, they can perch there. The doorman is entertaining, as other reviews have said, and everyone on staff was very nice and friendly. It was fun to watch the host and the servers dance around to the dj's music, and you get the sense that everyone who works there is happy to be there. A kid came around with a carafe of coffee to top us off, and we weren't charged for refills, which is as it should be (pay for refills? this isn't Europe!). The music was all really great, upbeat stuff, and the decor is delightfully eclectic. Downsides:  the seating is...cozy, the music is just a tad too loud (turning it down just a little bit would help so you don't have to shout to your companions or the server), and the restaurant is across the street from a gas station, so when the breeze blew in the open door, we got big whiffs of gasoline (delightful!). I had the egg mcruffin, which was really delicious but difficult to cut. My biggest issue with my meal was that the silverware provided is really chintzy. In trying to cut through an English muffin, I bent my cheap fork almost in half (HULK SMASH!) and scattered tater tots across the table while trying to saw off a bite-sized piece with the dull, crappy steak knife. It's a small thing, but the lack of decent silverware really detracted from the experience. You can go to Goodwill and pick up a bunch of inexpensive but sturdy silverware. Also, only giving one egg with the dish is a little weird. There are two halves of the English muffin, why not two eggs? We ordered the French toast balls to start, which I wouldn't recommend. For eight bucks, you get four hush puppy-esque balls of deep-fried bread with bits of ham and I think maybe some egg, and it's served with this weird sweet pickle sauce. I love fried stuff, but I wasn't a fan of any of the flavors. My mom got the biscuits & gravy, which she claimed to like (she's overly polite) but left more than half of it in the bowl and ate most of my tater tots. The two bites I sampled were disgusting. Gravy shouldn't be sweet, let alone sickly, syrupy sweet. And if you're going to have a syrupy sweet glop, don't top it with chives. It was just weird. From the menu description, it could be interpreted as maple cheddar sausage which is then put in a gravy, but I'm pretty sure they poured straight maple syrup into the gravy. Gross. My husband got the hobbits salty pork benedict, and it would've been great except that the biscuit was way overcooked--almost burnt--and dry. The fig jam with the hollandaise was amazing, though. His portion only got a tiny sliver of brie, and I think it would've been better with more brie. The plate was also dressed with a balsamic reduction, which looks pretty but tastes really weird with hollandaise. I could see coming back to give it another shot if I lived in Astoria and was hungover, but it's just not worth the sober trek. (If I did go back, I'd bring my own silverware.)",5,6,6,5

Luckily, we were seated immediately after checking in. Score! Despite the fact that I came in completely expecting to order the French Toast, i opted for the BLT + E instead. I'm a sucker for sandwiches with sunny up eggs! This one definitely did not disappoint. I actually wished there were more of it cause it was so good!

On a busy day, the staff at the average restaurant shows a bit of hustle, but at Rose Water everything seemed to take place with an ease of emotional detachment that might make the Buddha proud. Eventually we were allowed to sit, and order.  I asked if the eggs came with toast, because while this would seem obvious, I was beginning to have my doubts.  The waitress explained that some of the egg dishes came with toast and the one I was interested in came with some sort of home made bread.  At this point my blood sugar and patience had run low enough that instead of asking if the bread were served in the form of toast, I joined the rest of my party in ordering the pear crepes. Drinks were served, and then we waited, and waited, and after some exhausting amount of time the food was at last brought to our table.  Parts of my crepe were crunchy.  I don't know if that is a question of style or of sitting under a heat lamp for too long. The food was tasty enough but just didn't seem worth the higher-than-average price or the way-higher-than-average wait.

We weren't that hungry though so only ordered 3 appetizers. We got the papas rellenas which is basically 2 fried mashed potato balls stuffed with cheese served on top of a corn husk with some mashed plantains on the bottom. That was actually my favorite since the cheese was perfectly melted and the potato was nice and soft. We also got the camarones al ajillo which is a saut√©ed garlic shrimp served with garlic bread. That was probably my least favorite seeing as to how it had absolutely no flavor and the bread was harder than a rock. I think I almost broke my tooth trying to bite into it. And finally we also got the tostones con mojo which are fried green plantains in a garlic sauce. Those were perfect. They had a nice crunch and the garlic wasn't overbearing. I could tell this place has potential and I'm sure the actual dishes are good so I wouldn't mind returning but another ""meh"" factor I have with this place is the fact that it is tiny as hell.

So came back to the original, and had a great/fulfilling meal. The seating in the original Totto really bites.  Even after one hour of waiting time out in the cold, you're stuck at the bar with no place to hang your jacket.  They literally are in your face to order, and to pick up your check and leave because the # of seats are limited in this place and the demand is way too high.

Its a cute place - but definitely don't come here on a super hot day like we did because it is an indoor/outdoor design with no a/c (fans though!). Looking over the menu, I was surprised about how little brazilian influence there seemed to be on the brunch. Basically its a really normal, average, not very exciting brooklyn brunch menu except for one item: the feijoada which is a black bean stew that I wouldn't classify as a breakfast item really. There are plenty of brazilian-themed drinks though! My boyfriend got the stew and while it was pretty good, it wasn't $18 good. I got the eggs benedict which were fine but nothing to write home about. This place is probably better for lunch or dinner.",6,4,6,4

However, it's so easy to make at home so the price wasn't really worth the wait and the tight setting. I also got the spinach with rice and beans.

I don't eat red meat... well I can't say that anymore!  My friend convinced me to try the oxtail ragu and pappardelle one night.  I've gone back for it 3 times.  It is so delicious - tons of flavor, great pasta and salty.   The service is a bit inconsistent.  One night we had a very sweet woman who even let us send back a bottle of wine without a problem (it was really shockingly bright wine - we don't normally do that).  You can tell she genuinely loved the food and place.  Another night or two, service was really slow.   This is a great hidden gem within the loud, dirty atmosphere of St. Marks.

Can really recommend The octopus and the skid witch was awesome, also really good steak! They have a big table in the middle of the restaurant that I recon will fit ~20 something people that would be perfect if your celebrating your birthday out with friends and family Literally the only thing I can complain about is the time it took to get the food, witch was way to long but the staff offered bread and took orders for drinks so we were not totally forgotten ;)",8,7,8,6

I ordered the Miso Ramen and I have to admit the broth was nice thick and tasty just the way I like it. A also added the chicken tandori topping for $3 which was a total rip-off as they probably put 2-3oz of it on top. Overall great Miso Ramen but not the best and definately not worth the price (eg Momofuku Noodle Bar). Minca in the EV is much better. I have to admit the decor was beautiful. Overhyped, overpriced and feels like a tourist trap.",3,6,3,6

Restaurant is amazing, loved the interior, the service, the food and the overall vibe. Really good vibe immediately when we walked in. It was a $36 uber SUV drive from Central Park in traffic so well worth it. I had a few cocktails from their menu and they didn't disappoint so A + there. I am picky about my old fashion and they rocked it. The service was great, attentive but not in your face. Hipster but not overly. The gal who came around to ensure we had water, bread, etc. was on point, she was all over it which is great. I hate when I have to flag down staff but  I didn't so that was awesome. Food, what can I say it was great. I had the fried chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and it was the best comfort I had in a long while. Reasonably priced as well. I know all at my table enjoyed their meals as well. I would most definitely come back next time I am in town, I would sit at the bar if if I was by myself cause its just that good.

As a fan of craft beer, I gave them a passing grade on their beer selection.  The cocktails looked pretty damn good but I went with beer this time. Food was also good, again, small plates but everything we ate had great flavor.  Prior to 7pm they offered $1 oysters (usually $3 each) and though they were good, they were extra small. Other than the seasoned doorman who went out his way to explain how the place operates and show us the upstairs room, we didn't get any overwhelming sense of hospitality from the bartenders or wait staff as their websites implies.   Overall a cool place and I'm sure we'll be back.",7,2,7,2

It's place was solidified when I recently had my birthday dinner there. We started as a party of 8 and soon grew to 16. The staff just kept adding chairs and bringing more cold beers. Our waiter kept pace with our growing party and appetites. The food was delicious, plentiful and cooked to perfection. We ate until we couldn't eat any more. And then we ate some more. The total bill was very reasonable, around $20 each. The best part came at the end of the meal. The entire waitstaff brought out a plate of cupcakes (that my friends brought) ablaze with candles and sang out Happy Birthday. And when I say sang, I really mean more like screamed, at top volume. With the entire restaurant chiming in. It couldn't have been a more perfect ending to the meal. They only lose one star because it is a hectic place, and you do sometimes have to wait.",8,6,8,6

Note that it is pretty loud in there and a bit crowded but once you sit down and get into your meal & drink, you don't really give a damn. And I love the whole feel of the place. Of course--the most important part is the meal and both my date and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal.   If you love Thai food (or asian food in general), give them a try. Another note, I suggest making reservations because it does get pretty packed, especially Friday & Saturday night. When we left there were people waiting outside to be seated.",8,7,9,8

I'm usually afraid of places with a really big menu, but for all the different things they make I've never had anything bad there. It's a nice environment, service is attentive, and they have a very good beer and wine list for the neighborhood. My favorite dishes there: calamari arrabiata, mushroom risotto, yellowfin tuna salad, steak salad. Drawbacks: It's a small place, so during busier periods it's tough to get a table. I also find it to be chilly inside. Bring a sweater.",8,6,9,7

Light enough and super tasty. Sangria-braised Short Ribs - the short ribs were tender and full of flavor, but the cauliflower pur√©e was the perfect twist on this dish. Pacu fish ribs - these were a bit difficult to eat because the ribs are present. The fish is full of great flavors, though. We had a dessert sampler that was also great. I don't remember the names, but all of the desserts were light and flavorful. Overall, this place was really way above expectation, given the location on a street with many dying restaurants. I'll come back here to try all the other items on the menu. Victor, the manager, was very knowledgable and had great recommendations. Another detail worth mentioning: the mixology bar.

Being that we work with kids, a child-free drinking zone in the Slopey area was a godsend. At 6pm on a Saturday, the vibe was pretty mellow, lots of different aged people, only a teeny bit hipstery.  It was fairly crowded, and K and I managed to get the last 2 seats at the bar.  We ordered up some barleywine, booyah 11% alcohol.  We appreciated the coat hooks under the bar. The food system is sort of weird - I would prefer placing my order with the bartender, but instead one has to go up to a separate window to order & pay.  At least the food is delivered to your seat as well as bussed after eating.  Food was reasonably priced.  We had each ordered a sandwich and a salad, and the guy working the food counter warned me not to miss out on the fries.  So I took one for the team and got my sandwich with fries. K's grilled cheese on artisan bread looked good and met her approval.  My pulled pork was drippy, meaty, tangy, and divine.  Truly a masterpiece of pork.  After 3 barleywines each, we realized it was time to go when a) we kept falling off the stools, and b) when we realized that it was after 10 and the place had become overrun by hipsters.

Overall it is a cool restaurant and the food was good.  It is not the best ramen restaurant in New York, not even close.  Setagaya and Momofuku ramen blows this ramen away.

We ordered the Oyster Special x 6 with a glass of wine, as an appetizer. We moved on and ordered a bunc of appetizers - Calamari, Fried Oyster with yummy miso dressing then a steamers special. This place is as fresh as seafood can be. Although service is a bit spotty as we got an excellent server on Saturday night but not on Sunday.

Bathrooms are clean and lovely as well - always a good sign. Wanted to try something new so I went with the Soft Shell Crab Pong Garee (not spicy at all) and my friend got some sort of flat noodle soup with beef (only two stars spicy but holy hell, my mouth was on fire). We both loved our dishes and I have to say they were pretty hefty in size - neither of us were able to finish. The wait staff was nice enough - nothing to write home about. Fairly helpful with choosing our dishes but not so quick with the water when my taste buds were dying. Downfall being that with it being in NYU territory, it tried to cater to the younger generations with 90's pop. Not that I'm in any way against that music but it would be nice to have something a little more sedate and traditional in a place with such serene d√©cor - seemed very out of place.

So ""supposedly"" the lunch prices are good before 4 pm, which is fine since we were there BEFORE 4. They even gave us the lunch menus. But when we started off by ordering drinks they asked for our I.D. and took forever to look at it. So long in fact that by the time they gave them back to us it was already 4 pm. You would think that since we were seated before 4, and even given LUNCH menus that they would honor their lunch prices. Oh, but that was definitely not the case at this ""classy"" place. They literally took all of our lunch menus BACK and gave us the dinner menus. What kind of restaurant does that? Ridiculous. I really feel that they purposely took forever with our I.D.s so that we would have to pay dinner prices since we were a big group. On top of that, the service itself was terrible. It took forever for someone to come to order dessert and a friend of mine ordered a drink that never came. The food was alright, nothing spectacular.

Totto is more of Chicken stock soup base ramen joint.  If i want to have a bowl of Spicy ramen I will probably choose Totto's because their spicy paste is better. Ippudo still tops them in portion size and presentation.  The downside is their soup base gotten a little on the salty side.  The ramen is still one of the best I had because their ramen is authentic unlike other restaurants' (i think most other uses store brought Nisim brand instant noodle).  Soup is rich, appetizers are great.  The worst part of Ippudo is the wait time.

1166,89553,448,2/22/10,"After a day of rock climbing with my two besties, we went to Bogota to reward ourselves with strong cocktails and good cuisine. We were 15 minutes late for our 7:30 reservation and as such, we were bumped to the back of the 'waiting' line....and the line was long.  Our bad, I respect the restaurant's policies, especially on a weekend. Bogota was already alive and rocking, so we perched ourselves at the bar, ordered delicious Jalapeno Guava Margaritas, and carried on with conversation.  I am a sucker for spicey cocktails and generally benchmark a cocktail's quality against Yerba Buena's Pisco Picante - this one rose to the challenge and exceeded my expectations. Though we didn't end up sitting until 9 pm, Bogota's manager was attentive, apologetic, and accomodating, sending over an extra beverage to keep us satisfied.  Our server, Jacquelyn, was a gem - sweet and not over-bearing.  We ordered the Colombian hogao and queso blanco yellow cornmeal Arepas as well as the chicken tamale to start.  The tamale was HUGE, packed with chicken, and very flavorful - perfect for sharing with two others, but the Arepas were the highlight.  The tomato/scallion sauce was a little bit sweet, a little bit chunky, and a wonderful compliment to the toasted cornmeal cake.  We kept the dinner relatively light - salads, black beans, and the seafood stew.  The stew was quite good, but I was expecting a larger portion, a bit more fish, and a stronger likeness to the stews I ate in South America.  Don't get me wrong though - I would order it again tomorrow. Several glasses of wine, coffee, and some free after dinner mints later, our check arrived.  Affordable, relative to Manhattan prices of course, but I'll take it.  If I lived in Park Slope, I would cha cha cha back to Bogota at least twice a month, even just for the cocktails, an arepa, and a night with the ladies.  I recommend you do the same.

Yes it's weird that they don't serve lunch until 4pm on Saturdays, yes it's loud and you have to wait on weekends for what seems like an eternity, but on the plus side...the fries are great!! The brunch menu with mimosa is also great value. I have never had a disappointing meal here, it's a great place to meet someone for an informal bite and the breakfast/brunch menu never disappoints. I recently had the chicken meatball sandwich which was divine, and i'm also a fan of the pumpkin waffles, the salmon wrapped poached egg and...well, ok everything on the menu. The cakes are also a treat, I recommend the red velvet layer cake if you're going to indulge. My only two complaints are that the filter coffee isn't great (but then it is free as you wait) - and that the service could sometimes be friendlier depending on who you get. Other than that, this is a real find in NYC.",7,5,7,5

Numerous people came by to wish my boyfriend a happy birthday which I thought was sweet of them. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu and explained everything very thoroughly. The impeccable service really made dining here an occasion to remember! For appetizers we had the corn chowder and hamachi tartare. I'm not one to order soup at a restaurant but this was such a hearty and delicious soup. It was not overly salty nor creamy and there was an abundance of veggies and seafood. Both appetizers were much larger than anticipated. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp burger which he polished off in a few quick minutes, not because it was minuscule in size (because it was not!) but because it was so good. I decided to order the lobster and uni egg custard as an entree although the waiter warned me it's more of an appetizer sized portion. But I already had an appetizer and dessert coming so the egg custard with a few slices of bread was more than enough for someone with a smaller appetite. The custard was sooo silky, smooth, and rich - chock full of seafood essence yumm. I suggest you ask for a few extra slices of bread and smother a spoon full on top. By far the best part of our meal - dessert! We ordered the peach and raspberry sundae which had a touching story behind it and the lemon meringue. The lemon meringue was out of this world amazing!

Once for dinner which I had the mussels and for brunch which I had the omelet. It was as good, not overcooked and came a side of potatoes and greens. My friend had the waffles. They were fluffy and light with fresh fruit on top. It was sweet enough you probably don't even need to add syrup.

I'm sure the butter and mayo would've tasted amazing on the roll, but I got mine without the two because I generally like lighter, fresher flavors rather than rich and buttery. There was a generous portion of lobster served on a warm, toasted bun. SO GOOD. I like strong flavors so I could've used more spices on mine though. The Lobster Roll on its own was $15 ($16.33 including tax), which comes out to be a pricey lunch given the size of the roll, but definitely worth the indulgence every now and then.

1189,4351,510,11/3/14,"I came to Cafe Habana after hearing from multiple channels that it was one of the best Cuban restaurants to be found in Manhattan. Cuban cuisine isn't one of my fort√©s, to say the least, but I had yet to find a cubano to rival Coppelia's [1] and was looking forward to trying another contender. My friend and I arrived on the early end of a summer evening, and a quick assessment of the venue (open windows and doors on a humid evening) did not make for a great initial impression. Thankfully, we were able to get a table further into the dining area, which had a lone A/C placed overhead. I'd already come prepared knowing what to order, but my friend noted the overwhelming number of Mexican, not Cuban, dishes on their menu. Regardless of their origin, the menu offers a handful of starters and salads, a lengthier list of entr√©es and plates, as well as a comprehensive dizzying cocktail and beverage list. Most prices are pretty reasonable, especially given the downtown location of the restaurant, so it's more than feasible to order a few dishes to try. We started off with a plate of the Elot√©. It's typically more of a street food meant to be eaten on the go, featuring grilled corn with various condiments and spices. Cafe Habana's version is covered in mayonnaise, cotija cheese, and chili powder, and served with a wedge of lime. The corn kernels were surprisingly tough, an indication that the ears used were past their prime, and I was hoping for a more aggressive seasoning to help counter the creaminess of the cheese and mayonnaise. It was a solid starting appetizer, but lacked the punch of flavor I had been hoping for from one of their most lauded plates. For my main, I went with the Cuban Sandwich, which is served with a side of fries. It's generously portioned, consisting of marinated roast pork, ham slices, Swiss cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, and pickles, all sandwiched between two slices of a toasted roll. It's a perfect combination of ingredients: the savoriness from the pork and ham, some creaminess and spice from the mayonnaise and cheese, as well as a touch of acidity from the pickles. The bread has just the right crisp exterior and thickness to support all the ingredients as well, and makes for a satisfying chew. My advice would be to come to Cafe Habana just for the Cubano. The elot√© wasn't memorable at best, and my friend's pernil was dry and under-seasoned. It's not exactly the best place to go to in order to catch up with a friend as service is clearly rushed [2], but if you just want to dine and dash, it'll fit the bill. -- [1] yelp.com/biz/coppelia-ne‚Ä¶ [2] Our entree plates first arrived before we'd even touched the corn. They were brought out again after I was halfway through mine.",6,6,6,6

The first time the curry was amazing and the second it was really oily from the tofu. Both of the starters, the Chicken Satay and the Vegetarian Spring Rolls, were more or less miserable. The rolls were flavorless, the satay cloyingly sweet and tough. The Tom Yum was very sweet as well with a little too much fish sauce. Overall, the ambiance was very luxe given the reasonable prices; the service was great as well. Definitely not the best Thai food in NYC but great atmosphere and good service.

1192,127414,658,9/5/12,"I knew that we were going to sample real New York City pizza during our visit here, and have always believed that the best slices could be found not in overpriced Manhattan, but Brooklyn.  It was a choice between DiFara's Pizza (which has been featured on America's Test Kitchen), or L&B, featured on Man vs. Food.  Both looked great, but we decided on L&B because they also offered Italian ice after the meal, which admittedly swayed us.   I won't lie - we were kind of shocked by the surroundings.  Can we say sketch, boys and girls?  Seriously, a backdrop of high-rise projects wasn't what I'd had in mind - I felt like we were getting ready to dine at the (now-demolished) Murphy Homes in Baltimore, a prospect I wasn't looking forward to.  Parking was nearly impossible - there were cars lined up outside in the middle of the road and we were about to give up when we saw an empty spot across the street.  We grabbed it, and counted ourselves lucky.   There is zero organization to the ordering line(s) here.  People were just milling about all over the line and we didn't know where to go so that we didn't jump in front of anyone.  I hate ordering systems like this because you run the risk of being rude and cutting in front of people - a star off for that.  I was having so much anxiety that my boyfriend gently suggested for me to find a table, he'd order.  (Yes, it was gently - no ""shaddap, lemme do dis"".  Heh.)   We ordered half a tray of the Sicilian with pepperoni and mushrooms - yes, I KNOW, it's sacrilege to order the Sicilian with toppings, but TFB (too fuggin bad), it's how we roll.  At 19 dollars for half a tray (12 slices), the price difference is significant.  Besides, we didn't know if this was going to be good or not, so we went with the larger size - after all, if it sucked, we could just dump it somewhere, maybe in Central Park. Anyhow, it didn't take too long for the half tray to be done, maybe 15 minutes or so.  LoML brought it back with a couple of Cokes, and away we went.  Real New York City pizza.  This better be good. We opened the box to huge, greasy, saucy goodness.  My word, it was just beautiful.  I picked up an end piece and dug in - whoa.  This is some EXCELLENT pizza.  The bread was tender on the inside, crispy on the bottom, with just the right amount of melty cheese in the middle.  The sauce was just the right level of sweet and salty, perfectly balanced.  The mushrooms were perfect, the pepperoni just biting enough on the palate.  If this represents Brooklyn, I think I want to move here.  My boyfriend was enjoying it, too. I could only eat 2 slices - my boyfriend, 4.  I know, we're wimps.  But we wanted to save some room for that lovely ice cream.   I finished it off with a peach Italian ice that made me want to sing ""Ave Maria"".  Seriously.  This Italian ice was like no other I've ever had.  It was sweet, airy, light, and drippy.  It was wonderful.   My boyfriend got a shake - I don't even know what kind it was, it tasted like chocolate and hazelnut, but it was definitely delicious. So what did happen to the other 6 slices?  They didn't end up in Central Park after all, but in our bellies after a quick buzz in the microwave - in Baltimore.  Yes, they were even that good after we got home.  We sat in our bedroom, slowly munching the last of it, saying to each other that we'd best enjoy it while it lasts.   L&B Spumoni Gardens will definitely be on our list when we return to Brooklyn.  And we will.  After all, I have to start searching for that house.  :D",9,1,9,1
1193,35585,791,12/26/11,"Favorite Irish Pub. Favorite local restaurant. I've been coming to Molly's for over 15 years.  This is THE Manhattan spot for a burger.  The burgers are thick and juicy and come with fries that are golden brown, are not overly greasy, and actually taste like potatoes.   Other favorites include Shepherd's Pie, Fish and Chips, Bangers and Mash, Lamb Stew, and Cajun Chicken Salad.  All delicious.  Try the fried onion rings.  I don't know for sure, but they taste like they batter them to order.  If you order the pork chops, be pleasantly warned that you get two huge, thick, juicy, and delicious chops. Unless you have a big appetite, you may want to share the dish or you'll be taking leftovers home. If you order a salad, be sure to try their homemade blue cheese dressing.  The dressing is loaded with chunks of blue cheese.   As for beer, they have a great selection on tap. Guinness, Smithwicks, Stella, Bass, etc...  Once in a while, I'll treat myself to a Snakebite.  I also enjoy a Tullamore Dew or Jameson's (neat) after dinner. For brunch, try their Irish Breakfast.  It has all of the traditional components. Be sure to order the Irish coffee.  Don't stir it!  The coffee and dairy are suppose to be separate (looks like Guinness in a pint glass.)  When you drink it, you taste the hot coffee with whiskey, and then you're hit with the cool dairy. Heaven! In all my 15 years visiting Molly's, I've never had dessert. I've never had room after their generously sized dishes!  In any case, I'd rather have a Tullamore Dew than sweets after dinner! :) The staff is friendly and the food is served in a timely manner. The waitresses don't leave any empty pint glasses on tables.  They will always ask if you want another pint before the glass is empty.

We ordered starters and pizza along with a glass of wine for myself and a beer for my partner. His beer came out immediately and then 15 minutes later I got my glass of wine - not a good start. The appetizers were average and the service continued to be slow to non-existant. It felt like we were intruding on the staff's time to relax and chat for the rest of the night.

More often than not those reviewers happen to be African-American ( c'mon, I said I was keepin it real) After reading several credible reviews I expected Amy Ruth's to be good, if not great. But unfortunately after my visit here I was very disappointed. I ordered the 'Al Sharpton' - chicken n waffles and my boyfriend ordered the fried seafood combo w/ mac n cheese n string beans (I forget the official name of the entree). The fried chicken was dry and under seasoned. The shrimp was over cooked and the string beans tasted like water. The crab cakes were fried ( where they do that at) and the complimentary cornbread was so dry that I had to guzzle my entire glass of water to get the crumbs out of my throat.   Pricing is reasonable. I understand that they're there to make a profit. But I am a firm believer that quality should reflect price point and it clearly did not. The one good item that we were served at Amy Ruth's was the grape Kool-Aid. Don't judge me. I do realize I'm perpetuating a stereotype, but that Kool-Aid was DA BOMB!!!! I really hope that Amy Ruth's just had an off day because its right down the street from my apartment so I'd love to become a regular.

We waited for an hour and a half for a table for two on  a Friday night, but it was WELL worth it. The place looks small from the outside, and there is a little bar area by the door with some chairs to help with the long wait. But once we got seat inside the place was a lot bigger.

If I am going to invest that much time to wait for a bowl of ramen, I would much rather have Ippudo than Totto.  Don't get me wrong, the texture of the noodle and the soup base are all very good - but not as good as Ippudo nor even some of the other outfit like Daikokuya or Tsujita in LA or Ramen Santouka in Vancouver.

Fair warning, there's only one bathroom so you better not break the seal after a few drinks or you'll spend most of your time waiting on line. If you're looking for an app that's spicy, get the MAD Calamari because its MAD good but it'll also make your mouth breathe out FIRE so be careful not to burn your friend's hair to a crisp after eating this. For the entree, ordering the Gamberi pasta would be clutch on your part. It consists of a combination of shrimp and broccoli along with Rigatoni and is drenched in a tasty pink sauce which is a combination of marinara and something else. The drinks are reasonably priced but I would stay away from the Wilson's veto if you don't like strong drinks cause after drinking one of these, you may experience blindness, nausea, and most of all a HUGE headache. The service was great and the waiter/waitress will give you a questionnaire to fill out at the end of your meal so you know the restaurant cares about their customers.

This is what we had. GREEN MANGO SALAD | $13 charred chicken, lemongrass, mint, coriander, cashew, dried shrimp Thought: This is by far THE best Salad I have tasted in a long time. You taste every single spice as it melts in your mouth and every texture had a purpose. CRISPY PATA | $26 pork leg, pickled green mango, dipping sauces Thought: Everything about this Dish was amazing. Seriously the simplest dish with two types of dipping sauces.. I was floored!!!! GRILLED SIRLOIN | $15 lettuce, crispy garlic,spicy issan sauce Thought: SAY WHATT!!!! As a main course I was floored by this dish. the Meat was tender and melted in your mouth.. The sauce adds an amazing bit of sweet kick to take it to a whole new level. My Husband housed this in like 5 minutes flat.  I was able to sneak 2 bites in before it vanished.

And if you have a head cold this could possibly clear it out for ya..  lol. And they finished us off with their signature dish.. SIZZLING SISIG | $14 pork head, chili, whole egg Thought: The Chef and I did not tell my husband what this was because I doubt he would of been into this but this is one hell of an adventurous dish. For those who maybe like aww helll naw... seriously  try this.. the pork is tender and has a richer flavor then say a pork tenderloin. Then you add the chili with the egg and I am telling you.. the dish will surprise you! I loved everything about the decor of this place. We sat up close and personal with the chefs and enjoyed even the staff that works there.. I love their choice of old school hip hop and the vibe that flows through the whole restaurant.

You can also skip ahead and get beer to stay hydrated during the long trek to the meat counter. Once we got to the front of the line, we just decided to order some of everything. I mean, after waiting for about an hour, how could we not? My favorites? Definitely the short ribs, the pork belly and the brisket. The brisket was the best I've ever had (sorry mom), extremely moist and easy to tear apart. Try it! The pickles are good, but the broccoli salad is pretty in the norm.

Solid but not great.  Would only go again if there was not wait. Also, to sit a party of three they simply turn a two-top (that's the restaurant name for a table that sits two) sideways to make it an additional 5 inches wider but shorter???

I think at this point, the quality is pretty well documented. Few things. First, at $28 a pie, you probably won't make eating here a twice-a-week occurrence. But it's absolutely worth checking out at least once. You won't regret putting down that much cash for what amounts to 8 slices. Second, if you want to try to beat the wait, go when it opens or at off hours. We went Saturday afternoon when they first opened. No wait at all. In fact, we had the first pie out of the oven in about 5 minutes. Third, when you get your pizza, give it a minute. It's hot. You'll burn your mouth.

1258,81979,752,4/12/10,"*sigh* After encouragement from my sister, and the ""rave"" reviews on here, I decided to check this place out. Last night my family & I were in the area. We ordered the following three meals: ribs/macaroni & cheese/potato salad steak sandwich/cheese grits honey dipped chicken/yams/macaroni & cheese. I had the rib meal last night, and as I type at 5:08pm, my stomach is still engorged and bloated. I'm going to be quite frank here, but this place is not serving REAL soul food. This food is made for out of towners and people (non-black) who don't know what this food should REALLY be tasting like. I think most of the people who think this place is so amazing don't have black grandmothers and mothers with southern roots who can cook the HELL out of some food; have never been to a black cookout, or had food at a black church. Now THAT is cooking! I'm black myself and I had a feeling this place was overrated because (based on avatar appearance) barely any of the reviewers look like they have any point of reference for soul food. Sorry, but let's be real about the situation. Anyway, here's what I had some of: ribs- tough in some parts, store bought sauce. potato salad- TOO SWEET! mac & cheese- cheese overload & slight artificial taste. yams- straight out of the can... no butter or cinnamon I didn't the other stuff we ordered, but my mother said the grits were unsalted (that's a no-no!) So basically I'd say skip this place and head over to Cea-lo's in the Bronx... that's REAL food and better selection. I'll try to write a review for that next!",1,6,2,7

As a not-so-adventurous eater, the fried fish (complete with eye, tail, etc.) they put down in front of me at the beginning of the meal freaked me out a bit but, I have to admit, it tasted pretty good-- and it was all uphill from there. It helped that I went with a Korean friend who knew the ropes, but the staff was very accommodating of my relative lack of familiarity with the cuisine.  Had LA kalbi, which was excellent, and bibimbahp, which the waitress kindly helped me properly mix up with just the right amount of spicy sauce.  The star of the night, though, was this glass noodle dish called japchae.  The tofu was perfectly fried and the noodles were so flavorful-- I could go back for more of that right now!

Unfortunately, due to its popularity and small space, you may not have much luck walking in without a reservation. Expect a subdued atmosphere with wood floors, dim lighting, low noise, and - per the name - wine and flowers. While I skipped the wine on this particular night, my friends seemed right at home sipping their rose and nibbling on bread (and olive oil from rustic tin cans!) before the entrees arrived. At a great price point (approx. $15 for an entr√©e), the food arrived quickly and we found delicious, generous portions. Passing around the appetizers, the tartare (both salmon and tuna) as well as the caprese salad left no room for complaint. I went with the Bouillabaisse - very good and heaping with so much seafood goodness that I could barely eat half.

The shawarma was from fresh cut (not ground) lamb, which meant the quality was so much better than the comparable-priced food trucks around Washington Square Park.  But the shawarma lacked a bit of flavor (again, Tahini has better shawarma) and the pita also wasn't as fresh as Tahini's.  The line was long, but it moved pretty quickly around lunch time.

This is not that place.  So Sicilian pies are their thing here.  We ordered a plain cheese pizza and fried calamari.  Not really sure what the cost was for everything but it was $7 bucks per person which is pretty damn good.  But if you're looking for a good pizza, I would go elsewhere nor would I make a journey out here to grab a slice.   Their Sicilian pizza was very thick, with cheese on the bottom, sauce over the top, and that's it.  If you like wonder bread, you'd probably love their crust because that's what it reminded me of.  Way to doughy for my liking and missing that chewy characteristic I love so much.  The other edge of the crust was nice and crispy but everything else was just soft bread, not good.  The sauce was good, and I swear the put the sauce on top to cover up the fact they don't put any cheese on the pizza.  I honestly couldn't tell on two of my slices if there was any cheese on it and that's out of the 3 that I ate.   I understand a real Italian pizza is light on the cheese, but shoot, I should have some cheese on every slice.  Everything was fine though once doctored up with every condiment imaginable, hot pepper flakes, garlic seasoning, oregano, oh and of course parmesan cheese to make up for their lack of cheese.

The cream wasn't too heavy and just right + Escargot - I felt like a kid in a candy store when this dish arrived.  The escargot dish had 2-3 pieces of escargot in each one - SCORE!  We were so happy, and of course the escargot had tons of buttery goodness! + Salmon - it was a bit overcooked.  It wasn't the best I've had but not the worst either. Cute decor, great ambiance (makes me miss France), and the servers/waitress' were very friendly.  I'd come back for brunch next time but would skip dinner.",8,7,8,9

1313,127831,858,5/21/10,"This place is and always was one of my favorites. I read through the reviews, especially the bad ones and would just like to add my two cents: 1. Risotto is supposed to be served al dente. The wonderful thing about this place is how authentically Italian it is from the quality of the ingredients to the way they are prepared and paired.   2. You can choose gluten free or not. I started eating at Risotteria long before they served gluten-free alternatives. Whether or not you have gluten issues, you should try this place because the food is delicious! 3. Yes, the main attraction is the risotto, but their pannini are wonderful. Again, the best ingredients and put together in a truly authentically Italian manner. For example, they slice their meat to order- not at the beginning of the shift. They are extremely detail oriented. This spells quality! 4. If you had a bad experience with a waiter, that's too bad, but not a reason to stay away. Waiters come and go. To me, a much better indication of the quality of a restaurant is the kitchen staff. From the beginning, this place has had many of the same guys in their kitchen. That speaks volumes in a city where kitchen staffs change as often as baby diapers!",8,5,7,4

So if you feel like dance again, you just have to go upstairs. They have the outdoor space for smoking area so you don't have to stand on the street.

I couldn't even finish the mac & cheese because the portion of the mussels alone were so filling.

I was planning to go to Joe's Shanghai while in NY but decided I should try the noodles here since I love hand-pulled noodles and it's relatively hard to get back home. Went in and took a few minutes to look through the menu. It's pretty big. I asked the person helping me his favorite and he said the beef noodle and the most popular is the noodle soup with a variety of different meats. I didn't want too much meat since I had already eaten a lot lately so I opted for their fish ball dao xiao (knife cut) noodles. They had already run out by 2 pm so I chose their second most popular noodles which was the hand-pulled. When my bowl came out it was huge. For $5.25 I definitely wasn't expecting such a huge portion. I added a little vinegar and chili oil (provided at each table) and my soup was heavenly on a hot and humid day. The noodles were really good and made me wonder, how much more delicious is the dao xiao mien? My bowl also had hand wrapped wontons which were really good too. Service was very friendly, food was filling and a great deal and it's a nice hole in the wall (2 story) I enjoyed visiting. I will definitely be back my next trip to NY! Cash only",8,6,8,4

We got: Crispy Calamari yuzu dipping sauce and sesame. BEST CALAMARI i've ever had. crispy, airy, tasty. the sauce was a perfect compliment to the calamari. this was my favorite dish. Crispy Poached Eggs caviar and creme fraiche ($17 supplement). i thought this was good, but i wouldn't get it again. ""crispy""=deep-fried, fyi. this was the bf's favorite dish. Fried Chicken mushroom spaetzle and ginger vinaigrette. this has been raved about in several magazine articles i've seen so i was excited to try it. i think it was overly-hyped for me, but still definitely worth checking out. Grilled Yellowfin Tuna Burger bonito mayonnaise, shiso and yuzu pickles. SO GOOD. this was my 2nd favorite dish (after the calamari). for dessert we had warm Valhrona Chocolate Cake with vanilla ice cream and some sort of banana shortcake.  both were good - but it's hard to go wrong with dessert. :) the decor is really simple and clean.

They have the best mussels I've had outside of Brussels and their beer list is second to none. Excellent place for sunday brunch but also laid back enough to take out of towner's who don't usually 'get it' lol. My family's from the south and they really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and polite service. I consider Petite Abeille one of the better restaurants in the Chelsea/Union Square area. The waffle and ice cream is the ultimate splurge but the meatloaf is noteworthy as well. Did I mention the french fries!? Summertime on the back patio is nice also.

We had the mussels, sardines, and artichoke (crack) dip for starters.  Our group ordered every entree off the menu except for the duck and everything ranged from good(Fluke, Trout, Mac n Cheese) to delicious (Filet Mignon, Pork Shoulder).  We finished up with the banana foster, cheese plate, and toffee cake.  Add a whole bunch of cocktails into that equation and we had a great evening. I highly recommend Freemans.

I ordered the  Latin Benedict, whereas my companions ordered the skirt steak and eggs (which was very delicious).  My dish was pretty mediocre, and TINY!

1354,62467,521,1/7/10,"Plastered on the walls of the smoky interior of a little pizza joint in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn are years of praise lavishly bestowed on Domenico DeMarco, proprietor and still principal pizza preparer. Since 1964, DeMarco has stood guard over the gargantuan oven with dough in hand. So why is the joint called Di Fara when it has always been DeMarco as the stalwart pizza maven? His original business partner was named Farina, and a portmanteau of their names became the famous Di Fara. Now most people who pride themselves on NY pizza perspicacity will have much to say about Di Fara, but outside the NY circle, large as it may be, Di Fara has not reached the fame of some of the other pizza places. I theorize that this has nothing to do with the quality of the pizza, but rather on the refusal for DeMarco to scale up his operation. The pizza procuring procedure is Byzantine at best, and arriving with a guide is not a bad idea. After waiting the requisite wait in the line that forms outside the restaurant at all hours, make your way up to the counter and choose from the $5 slices or opt for a ~$30 pie. Someone, likely one of DeMarco's children, will write up your order on a scrap of paper and simply call you when it's ready. The additional wait for the pizza could take quite awhile, but you should make sure you return in time, lest your pizza be presented to another patron. $5 for a slice of pizza. Expensive, yes, but Di Fara doesn't fail to bring in the crowd. Since I didn't make the trip out to Brooklyn too often, I had a slice of the thin, a slice of the deep-dish, and another thin crust pie. While utterly delicious, the pizza was undeniably oily. And though DeMarco might be making each pie himself, there were issues with consistency. Some crust comes out burnt, some too soft. The ingredients are tossed on capriciously by hand, though I'll admit there might be some sort of strategic topping placement that I didn't perceive. As you can see, the pizza is not much to behold, and from experience, I can tell you that next morning cold Di Fara's isn't nearly as appetizing. Given the long wait, hassle of ordering, cost, and inconsistency, I can see why Di Fara is often a hit or miss for pizza pilgrims. Still, if you're comparing the best pies in town, you can't leave out Di Fara as a contender.",2,5,3,5

I really think Clinton St's pancake is nothing to talk about  - also it's overprice $15 for 3 pancakes....  I agreed that the caramel butter dipping is good -- but not that good to make the blah pancake worth one and a half hour wait.  My husband got the frittata and he said it was ok.

The Risotto is good and the Meatball Sliders are a must. So start with those. I go with meats for the mains with the succulent Pork Chop or my favorite, Lamb Shank which melts in your mouth.

Each time I return, the service seems to go down a notch, the prices go up little, and the food stays about the same.  Now, I have no problem paying for overpriced pancakes and eggs as long as the service is decent, the food is up to par, and my overall experience is enjoyable. However, on my most recent experience, I had the unfortunate experience of having a server who had a ""could give a crap less"" attitude, which didn't make for the greatest start to the meal.  But that's fine, I was still going to enjoy my meal there. Luckily on this occasion I only had to wait 5-10 minutes for our table.  In the past, depending on how late you got there, a wait for a table of 2 could be over an hour. But I digress, I thought I made my order pretty clear asking for one of their signature dishes - my usual (Banana Walnut Pancakes) - without one main ingredient - nuts.  I'm deathly allergic and just ask for the order without walnuts.  Pretty simple, right?  Unfortunately not if your server isn't really paying attention.   After getting our food and knowing what the order is supposed to look like, I knew that the server had gotten my order wrong.  We tried to find the server, who seemed to have disappeared.  We finally tracked him down and waved him over, to which he assumed we wanted our check, since this was the first time he came in the vicinity of our table after taking our order.  Apparently, it would be too much to expect that he check-in to see how everything was after we received our food.   I explained to him that I wanted the Banana Walnut Pancakes, without walnuts.  To which he responded ""So you just want saut√©ed bananas.""  I agreed, not realizing what he actually entered my order as.  He was kind enough to come over after returning my order to the kitchen and said it would be out in about 3 minutes.   My order reappeared in about 1.  It seemed right, not taking a bite out of it initially.  However, it seemed that the raw, fully sliced banana that was sitting on my pancakes a few minutes ago had merely been replaced with saut√©ed bananas, about 3 slices to be exact - it usually comes with about 6 slices, as I could tell from the indentation made by the initial banana.  As a patron (and past employee) of any good restaurant, returned food should NEVER be merely replaced, if not thrown out all together.  It should be completely re-done and made to order as requested by a customer.  This would have been something that the server realized had he ever come over to actually see how our food was, especially after being returned to the kitchen.   I ate about half of my meal, since I didn't really enjoy it as much as I usually did, but I couldn't completely put my figure on why.  The pancakes just seemed different.  After receiving our check, I finally realized why my usual delicious order of Saut√©ed Banana Walnut Pancakes just didn't taste as good.  Instead of getting the Saut√©ed Banana Walnut Pancakes, I instead received sour dough pancakes with bananas added.  Interesting, since I didn't even know I could add-on fruit. My husband found the eggs to be a bit runny and the food overall just OK.  The biscuits were delicious as always, although smaller than they have been in the past. To say the least, we won't be returning to Bubby's any time soon, if ever.  I would love to give this place I once used to love another chance, but I find it difficult when it just seems like too much to ask for your food to be what you ordered and actually have servers who care and work for the gratuity that they are getting.  There are WAY too many good restaurants in this city to waste our time waiting in line for overpriced, mediocre food here.  Especially when our brunch for two of pancakes, eggs, juice, and soda, not one ounce of alcohol drank, ran us $65.  I can get much more bang for my buck somewhere else.  And their cash only policy seems quite shady.",6,4,6,7
1364,2241,492,3/5/13,"I have been overly excited to write my review on Tabare, and have been waiting until I  tried just about everything on their menu. Tabare is currently, hands-down, my favorite restaurant in New York City. Situated in Williamsburg, on South 1st Street between Driggs and Roebling, it's tucked away on a street that is quite unassuming. Located where there are only a few other restaurants in the perimeter, Tabare is a hidden gem (understatement). Tabare specializes  in Uruguayan cuisine, with French and Italian influences. It is a place that everyone should experience once in their lifetime-- and after you go once, it will too become your new favorite spot. I took Kyle here on his birthday for the first time, after hearing fantastic reviews from my friend Corinne (follow her at brooklynmunch.com). It was a hot summer night, and we went around 9PM. The atmosphere is dimly lit, and the lighting is perfected. Everything seems to have a glow, the music is sexy, and the atmosphere is cozy. We have since been back for happy hour/dinner with Corinne and her boyfriend, our friends Sam, Vinnie, and Glenn for a Sunday night dinner, and my best friend Andrea just last Sunday for brunch. My two favorite menu items at Tabare (which are a must have at every visit), are the mussels and the provoleta. The mussels are perfect, served in a white wine broth with shallots and parsley with hot, buttery garlic bread. The broth is so good that we always ensure extra bread for dunking/soaking/obtaining every last morsel. (Corinne loves it so much she once asked for the broth to go and used it the next day for pasta). The provoleta is unlike anything I have ever had. Served piping-hot out of the oven, provoleta is baked bubbly provolone cheese with oregano. There must be other secret spices (or perhaps crack) in this dish because it is so damn good! They serve the provoleta lined with a crostini fence. Dive in quick because as it cools, it becomes harder to eat. The empanadas are the other must-have. We have tried all four of their selections, but the cheese and onion empanada is by far the best. The empanada dough is homemade, stuffed with gruyere, fontina and caramelized onions, and fried until they are perfectly crispy......... Need I say more? (Didn't think so). The cheese is so soft and flavorful and the onions are sweet and savory. The hand-cut grass fed beef and olive empanada is also delicious. I'd skip on the tuna and chicken-- both still good, but the other two blow them out of the water. The grilled octopus casserole with lima beans, paprika, lemon and aioli was also ridiculously delicious and unique. The chorizo with roasted onions, red peppers and adobe sauce is another well executed dish, bursting with flavor and just the right amount of spicy. The blood sausage toast with poached egg and arugula salad was not my favorite menu-item, but I'm also not the biggest fan of blood sausage... Our friend Glenn described it well:  'quite gamey'. (We were feeling a little crazy when we ordered it, since we had already ordered just about everything else on the menu. Why not?). Hopefully you will have reserved enough room for a main entree, because the best is yet to come... The Churrasco main entree at Tabare is my favorite main entree in all of New York. Grass-fed skirt steak, with chimichurri, potato confit, and a market salad is served on a deep oak colored wooden cutting board. My mouth is salivating thinking about this. The steak is huge and cooked absolutely perfectly so it melts in your mouth. The chimichurri, which is a cilantro and parsley based sauce explodes with flavors. I'm talkin' a flavor EXPLOSION. It acts as a marinade for the steak, and is then drizzled on top of the cooked meat. The side of potatoes I assume to be cooked with thyme and rosemary and are so crispy, and compliment the steak very well; the salad is simple, light and refreshing. Tabare also offers a 'Specials' menu everyday, always featuring a ravioli or pasta dish. I've tried two of their ravioli specials which were both fantastic. Pictured below is their ravioli stuffed with potatoes and leeks, tossed in a brown butter sage sauce, mixed with rainbow chard. I highly recommend Tabare. The service is phenomenal, the staff is friendly, and the cocktails are great. They also serve beer and wine. Also, I forgot to mention the hot bread served upon arrival, paired with an olive tapenade. It's addicting. If you live in Manhattan and you're debating going to Tabare because it's in Brooklyn, it's worth the extra 5 minutes on the L train. Plus, if Tabare was located in Manhattan, the prices would be doubled,  and it would probably be impossible to get a table. PS- They offer brunch starting at 12PM which is also (and obviously) phenomenal!",9,9,8,8
1365,89461,448,12/5/11,"We've been to Bogota a few times and have always enjoyed it. The food is delicious, they have tons of veggie and gluten-free options and the staff is friendly. We've even had it delivered and found the food just as delicious. But the staff went above and beyond this weekend. After accommodating our last-minute five-adult, one baby party for brunch in their giant dining room, they managed to find my expensive Invisalign trays that had mistakenly been cleared from the table. The bus boys fished them out of the downstairs garbage and they even washed them off before returning them to me. I can't imagine a place going more above-and-beyond than that! This is a great place for large groups, small groups, any groups!",9,8,8,7

1367,140878,741,5/29/12,"I've lived next door to Penelope's for almost a year now and am amazed by the length of the consistent line outside for brunch. It's nearly an hour wait every Saturday and Sunday. On the few occasions I have managed to try it out for breakfast/brunch, I was a bit disappointed. The food was fairly good but nothing worth such a wait. If you can catch it on a weekday or an off hour, it is a nice place for a quiet meal to catch up with friends.",4,4,3,4

It was ok, nothing special about it-the noodles were chopped up into smaller pieces, but overall it was pretty dry and flavorless, even after adding on hot sauce. The pork appetizer was satisfactory as well. This place is pretty big, and there's outdoor seating in their back patio.  Service was chill.  Cash only.",4,4,4,5
1369,21984,263,10/14/12,"I'm almost always hungry when I wake up. From the brief afternoon naps to the epic Sunday sleeps, I'll want to break bread upon opening my peepers. This morning is not one of those cases after Leslie D's birthday dinner last night at Scarpetta. In the battle of man versus food, food not only won but altered my gastrointestinal system in such a way that I may just have a spoonful of granola three hours from now and call it a day. When trying to find this restaurant, don't look for a sign with the name clearly spelled out: it's not. Instead look for the number 355 on 14th Street. Then you will enter a dark world of upscale Italian dishes populated by well dressed and well heeled eaters. Literally dark. Trying to read the drink menu at the bar without supplemental light was an act in squinting and waiting for Prometheus. Eventually, my eyes adjusted to the cave like lighting and they were ready to examine the upcoming feast. And, dear yelpers, your photographs of spaghetti were enough to convince me that this was what I desperately needed to order. Yet the pictures also gave the impression that this was a dainty dish, a few twirls worth of homemade pasta goodness and on to the next plate. So I pre-gamed with boquerones at a nearby tapas bar, thinking I'd made the right move. Not quite. Firstly, the spaghetti is unveiled by the lifting of a cover as if royalty is reviewing the latest bounty from the New World. I could see Ferdinand and Isabella nodding their approval once the lid is lifted and beginning to chow down. What deceived me was the actual depth of the dish. It's as if discovering that Kim Kardashian is a Rhodes scholar who can discuss international politics: not just a flashy exterior but also substance! So it was with the spaghetti, simply prepared with tomato and basil. Keep your Ragu jars to the pasta sauce aisle at Keyfood, this dish was not at all drowning in red sauce but rather each piece of homemade spaghetti was lovingly lightly covered in tomato. Cheese? Not at all necessary as the primordial ingredients spoke for themselves. I'd have it again in a heartbeat, a $24 heartbeat at that. Other highlights included creamy polenta served with a truffled mushrooms. It's like eating a stick of butter, a quart of heavy cream and living to speak about it. I generously borrowed a few spoonful of my wife's appetizer and realized that my very tasty braised short ribs with risotto, while amazing, still couldn't reach the ethereal heights of dairy delight. The dessert that added the final nail to the coffin of appetite destruction was the semifreddo. It's half cold but all delicious. I was surprised by the inclusion of a sweet potato gratin, an orange square that seemed out of place on a plate of mousse and chocolate crumble. Combining all three ingredients justified the sweet potato but the dish would have been just as amazing without it. Note that Scarpetta is crowded and cramped- you may bump elbows or be bumped by waiters and other guests. But for a special occasion it's well worth the struggle and squinting for a taste of spaghetti heaven.",6,4,7,6

Aside from the falafels, the Mexican has crispy nachos, jalapenos, pico de gallo, guacamole, lettuce... and tastes so good!

The ham and cheese paquetitos are little gooey packs of happiness. The chorizo with sherry is a bit oily, but resolution breakingly delicious. (Hey if you are going to break your resolutions... don't do it with Wendy's.) The chorizo with chocolate is good, though if you are going to mix meat and chocolate, I prefer the chocolate ribs at Kittichai about 10 fold. The fried garbanzos are a bit bland, but pretty much everything else is killer. And did I say small? Yeah, portions can be a little on the Kate Moss side, which is not bad in and of itself, but if you are actually hungry, be prepared to spend some money.

1379,27441,482,2/23/09,"I don't typically give out 5 stars, and truth be told, I hesitated to do so here - but when I started to remember the food, I realized I could not be stingy. The negative first: Why did I hover over 4 stars?  The decor is just fine, but I typically feel a five-star restaurant will have something special about the interior.  Here, I felt nothing.  Perhaps I'd have had a different experience if we were able to get in on the actual dining room, but when we called for a reservation at about 5pm that Sat, every table was booked and we were left to chance as to whether we'd find a spot at the bar.  Rather than have to sit at the bar, there are two small tables that you can snag across from the bar, and we were just lucky enough to get one of them. I guess that makes it a 5-star situation, since you can still hope to steal a chance to dine at Hearth in spite of its extreme popularity any given night! The other minor thing that made me want to almost give Hearth a 4 - the music situation was odd.  I noticed a random variety of pop going on in the background at any given time - especially when a song came on after what was perfectly fine music-less silence (and the gentle hum of diners talking). But onto the good -- THE FOOD!!! I went with, yes, FD, and we both got the seasonal tasting ($76 for 5 courses, subject to change each day).  The house was kind enough to offer a warm turnip soup to warm us up, and it was rich and somewhat sweet.  The tasting began with a fabulous poached lobster with lobster tortellini - this was by far my favorite dish - what a way to start.  The lobster was tender and cooked to perfection, while the tortellini was like nothing I've ever put in my mouth!! The pasta was thin and delicate, not unlike a wonton skin, and the filling was heavenly. Next was a pork sausage with another pasta I cannot recall the name of (long and flat).  Again, the pasta was very delicate, obviously made fresh daily, and allowed you to really enjoy the sauteed sausage and broccoli rabe. No heavy creams or sauces, just a purity of flavor. We followed with the main course - ribeye of beef with short ribs, beets and marrow.  The pieces of ribeye were absolutely perfect, and the minced beets a great companion (although perhaps would have been better in bigger slices).  Of course, who can say anything bad about marrow... but the short ribs seemed a bit much. I'd honestly have left this off the dish, as it was just seriously overloading it. Finally - two, yes TWO desserts! First an orange parfait with candied pistachios.  Great texture and tartness, a nice way to cleanse the palate and ready you for the passionfruit souffle with chocolate sauce.  I loved the lightness of this souffle - as they tend to be overly chocolate and heavy, and that the flavor was passionfruit was definitely rather unique.  FD believed he had never had such a wondrous dessert in all his life (and he's lived much of it in France). We paired this meal with a fabulous bottle of I don't know what (FD picked it out with the help of a very knowledgeable sommelier), and it was served at the perfect temperature.  I have to say, I always love a good sommelier. Service was really good -- each dish was introduced, plates cleared timely, wine and water refilled aptly.  We never felt rushed, and was permitted to enjoy our food and have a serious conversation (I felt a bit sorry for the staff, as I could tell they were trying to not interrupt our talk, while providing excellent service). So yeah - a rare five-star review from Joan H! The food simply communicated dedication and love, and the staff was more than happy to share that with you.",9,9,8,7

It has poblano peppers, black beans, and onions with your choice of chorizo (our choice) or mushrooms smothered in queso blanco and accompanied with fresh tortillas. An excellent dish. We also saw that many people were ordering the guacamole, but we were very happy with our choice. For dinner, I ordered tacos a la carte, and my partner ordered a taco and quesadilla. The tacos ranged from good to excellent. I had the bistec and carnitas enchiladas, which were both good, but I highly recommend the pescado (fish) taco. It was fantastic, one of the best I've had. My parnter ordered the bistec taco and the quesadilla huitlacoche, which is a quesadilla filled with mushrooms that grow on corn. It was interesting and delicious. The mushrooms had a sweet, subtle corn flavor that came through as you ate them. Highly recommended. Take your time and savor. For drinks, my partner had the red sangria, which was average, but she enjoyed it. I had a margarita, which was decent, but too sweet for my tastes. I prefer to taste the tequila. However, after I finished my margarita, I ordered El Viejo, which is a mezcal-based version of the Old Fashioned. It was excellent, and I highly recommend it to lovers of the Old Fashioned. We ended the dinner with the Pudin for dessert. Again, outstanding. I'll just give you the menu description and let your mouth water; mezcal tres leches bread pudding with pineapple, banana, chocolate chips, and chocolate sauce. And, yes, it is as good as it sounds. Again, highly recommended. Great atmosphere, great serve, great food. Whoever created this restaurant certainly had a vision.",9,7,8,6

We also ordered the chicken liver toast to snack on. Very nice portion of buttered toast triangles spread thickly with savory liver spread, offset by the sweetness of the jam, with a side of pickled vegetables. It was very enjoyable.

And to top it off, they had heavy red velour curtains hanging over the main exit. That can't be right in NYC.   Now to the food: The prices charged for appetizers ($18), and side dishes ($10) are obscene. If I was in a supper-club, with entertainment, OK. But in a ""steak and burger joint"", the prices are absurd.  The $140 steak for two is not, I repeat, not Peter Luger's quality for almost twice the price here. And the other $40-50 steaks aren't either. Now to the $26 burger; it's a thick burger on a bun, with crispy fries. Good meat, good flavor. All in all, not a place to rush to. NYC has many more places to enjoy fine meats at, with better prices, and with a much classier dining room.   P.S. The souffle was delicious and more than enough for two to share.",7,5,4,6

I was also referred by my friend to this specific Halal cart for (maybe) the best gyro cart in entire New York City. They might be right. My friend already told me, it was across the only Hilton Hotel in NYC, and you would recognize it by the long line they had. And indeed when I was trying to look for a place to park, this was the only place that had long line for a cart vendor. I got in line and ordered 3 lamb gyro over rice to go with sauce separate and 4 lamb gyro sandwich with hot sauce. I took home the 3 gyro over rice for my friend who ordered them cos he couldn't come with me and I ate the sandwich on the spot. One thing, it was indeed very good. The white sauce made it all better, and I love spicy food, so the hot sauce (which was really spicy and hot) gave more kick to my gyro and I loved it to the core. The line was long, but quick. The people of the cart were really nice, effective, and efficient, they were indeed pros. The price of gyro sandwich was 4$ and the gyro over rice was 6$, very cheap. The gyro was freshly cooked and because of the popularity, they were always fresh, therefore this is indeed the best place to get a gyro. It was cheap, very cheap, very good, and very excellent for a mere food cart on the street. It is the rare 5/5 rating! Wohoooo!!! It's been a while since I gave this 5 stars, so I was pretty hyped about this. This will be the only place that I would visit over and over again if I were ever to come back to NYC.",9,4,8,5

My friend pretty much had nothing bad to say about their meatloaf. For dessert, I had the chocolate pudding cake and my friend had the apple crumble pie. First of all, the portions were huge! The pudding cake was incredibly moist and rich but most importantly, not too sweet. My friend couldn't finish her pie but it wasn't very syrupy, which is a plus in my book.

1404,976,251,3/5/08,Since I am too tired and too lazy - I will cut this review short since my first review got erased.  (grrrr) I wasn't too into the Ssam - pork belly with razor clam.  I love razor clam and this place totally killed my love.  I couldn't even detect any traces of the clam.  I know it's in there since I put in there myself but it just wasn't flavorful enough for me. I would however only come back just to have their steam buns with pork belly and their Cracked Empress Jonah Crab Claws with yuzu mayo.  But then again who can really mess up boiled crab claws? Overrated but 4 stars just for the two appetizers and nothing else.

It lacked a bit of salt and would of been easier to eat had it not been 4 huge wedges of tofu the size of my fist. Entrees: Hokkien Char Mee - thick egg noodles sauteed with veggies, shrimp, squid, chicken, pork, and beef.

1408,15640,398,3/7/13,"So how does one bypass the 1 to 2 hour wait at 6:00 on a Friday? You saddle up to the bar as a single diner that's how. Yep, have no shame, just go try it and enjoy yourself some home style Japanese cooking. Halfway through dinner I struck up some conversation with a Japanese couple and they told me that there are hundreds of Ootoyas in Japan and they serve a healthy kind of fast food. This one is apparently a high end, home style version. First off, there are a lot of choices on Ootoya's menu. There must be 75+ items available for order. You should just accept that there will be items you will have to make a 2nd trip to try. All of the dishes were also presented in an artful and visually appealing way. I started off with the japanese tofu and it had a sesame, soy like, nutty flavor. For some reason I was expecting a fried tofu but it arrived in cup and it had a consistency similar to flan. Another pleasant surprise was the tuna carpaccio. I thought it would arrive as pounded flat tuna with oil and some spices but instead I got a nice looking plate of domino sized blue fin tuna (check out the photo). The tuna was seared perfectly and it came with a pickled radish and shallot salad. I then moved onto some yakitori and the beef, potato and cheese croquettes. The yakitori I had was average. The liver was good as was the thigh meat with garlic. The breast meat with wasabi was basically eating wasabi. You get to choose either a sweet sauce or a salt wash with your yakitori. My suggestion would be to skip them and try some of the other dishes. The meat and cheese croquettes were really satisfying. The exterior was crunchy (they arrived resting on a mini wire rack to prevent the bottom from getting soggy) and the interior was hot and savory. Lace it with some of the semi sweet sauce and you have a japanese version of a fried shepherd's pie. Amazing right?!? I washed all this food down with some tap beer, although I wish the glasses were pints and not pilsner glasses. The service at the bar was great, I had my water refilled multiple times and plates cleared accordingly. I saw many guests eating mackerel box meals and half bowls of rice and fish. A few dishes I will need to return and try include the soba, the pork belly and maybe a hot pot.",8,8,7,7

The food is wonderfully adventurous and watching it get prepared before your eyes makes for a good show. Wine List is good as well. One Problem. The Hostess. We support new spots in our hood. When this place first opened it was Quietsville. No one was showing up and we decided to take a chance. We had a great night. Food and music was spot on.  We were happy and excited when the restaurant popped off and people started to come. But sadly,  the hostess has not been trained or just has a bad attitude when it comes to greeting guests when the place is busy. On more than one occasion, we have wandered into Bergen Hill on a whim to see if we can get a nice dinner / drink. The first time, the hostess (without looking up or making eye contact) asked if we had a reservation. I said: No but...we were wondering if we could---and before i could finish my sentence she barked: Sorry we are fully booked and walked away from us. My wife and i aren't sensitive people at all but this was just stank. She was really rude. We shook it off, thinking it was just a one time thing and she was really stressed out and new to the fury of having to juggle seats at a small eatery BUT it happened 3 more times. She really has turned us off to this place. and it's sad because the head chef is so personable and sweet and the restaurant is just awesome. like i said, the vibe is great and the food is delicious but if the first face you see and interact with is unpleasant, it can really poison the well. get thee to a learning annex workshop, girlfriend. stop throwing shade and being so stank. you don't want to alienate your core diners, the ones who live in the neighborhood and want to have a nice bite at the bar two nights a week. just saying.",3,7,4,7

All these complaints seem to be from people that haven't had the pancakes or the breakfast. Going here for something other than pancakes is like going to a fantastic burger joint and ordering a hot dog. You've only yourself to blame. I've seen people from the likes of Jon Stewart to Harvey Keitel enjoying the amazing breakfast that this restaurant offers. The pancakes are a bit on the pricey side but well worth it. You know a place cares about their pancakes when they give you a jug of real maple syrup. You know a place doesn't care enough when they give you a jug of the fake stuff. Finally, you know a place is hoping you don't even order the pancakes when they give you those little syrup packets. Thankfully, Bubby's is a place that cares. Every time I come here I order the sour cream pancakes and they never let me down. I might have trouble getting up after eating them because they can be pretty heavy. They aren't as light and fluffy as Clinton St. Baking Company but they are just as tasty. I would say that these are more like ""Man""cakes. They have a sweetness that can satisfy the delicate types and a heartiness that can make even a fat guy split it with you. Of course they have other things here, specializing in ""comfort"" food. Their lunch and dinner are ok but of course the breakfast is where it's at. Don't get me wrong. I like meatloaf just as much as the next guy. I just can't remember the last time I jumped for joy after eating it at a restaurant. Mac n cheese as an entree just makes me want to laugh and think of my old college days. With such and fantastic breakfast, I just wish they would have omelettes on the menu instead of just the special ""omelette of the day."" I'm also a big fan of a place that has cheese grits. No shame in admitting it. You don't need to own a mobile home to enjoy these. If you come on a weekend morning you'd better arrive shortly after it opens or be prepared to wait.

The restaurant is Taiwanese, but trafficking in a style of noodle associated with northern China. Wherever the exact origin of the chef, the results are excellent. The elbow-shaped street where the hand-pulled noodle shop is located is a wonderfully bizarre assortment of establishments - from the historical yet touristy Nam Wah Tea Parlor to the upscale twin speakeasies on the corner. A meal for two is available at Nam Wah for the price of a cocktail at either of those places, with a choice of protein. I'd go with the sweet roast pork or the chewy pieces of beef, both of which add heft and texture to a stir-fry. There is beer here, so this would make a nice place to get a little loose before heading to the weekly jazz nights at Apotheke. While perhaps not the very best noodle in the City, this is certainly a welcome addition to Chinatown. The half dozen or so tables seem constantly booked whenever I walk by.

1421,4943,508,9/24/12,"By now New Yorkers are familiar with Chef Michael White's work. The Wisconsin native's star has steadily risen ever since his arrival in the New York restaurant scene. Aside from Osteria Morini he oversees the Michelin-starred restaurants Marea and Ai Fiori and just a few months ago opened the pizzeria Nicoletta. Osteria Morini opened in late 2010 and within a few months made it into every food critic's list. An homage to his years in Italy and to the cuisine of Emilia-Romagna, the restaurant oozes in warm boisterous appeal. From the terra cotta fa√ßade to the walls filled with various kitschy Italian country d√©cor, the cute grandma plates to the hearty laughter and conversation that spreads throughout the dining room, Morini is an endearing showcase of White's cooking and hospitality. The menu is filled with rich, meat-centric dishes that are generously flavored and over all hovers along the border of excess. Start with an antipasto or share a selection of cured meats and cheese to excite your appetite. Be careful not to go overboard though since you must have the pasta here. Whether it's the gnocchi, tortellini, ravioli, or tagliatelle the pasta is as close to perfection as you can find in this town. Perfectly al dente and neither overwhelmed by the sauce nor lacking in flavor each dish will delight you. The saffron pasta with shrimp and mussels in particular is delicious and any that are paired with meat rag√∫ is highly recommended. Entr√©es of fish, Cornish hen, and spit roasted meats complete the menu but if it's your first time then save those for the next visit and savor the glorious pasta. Or come with a larger group and share everything family style. The wine selection is a smart selection of wines from the region which gives diners a chance to learn about and enjoy the wonders of the Italian sparkling wine lambrusco. In fact the lambruschi can be enjoyed as flights of 3-ounce pours each. For dessert opt for the sublime panna cotta with seasonal toppings or if you need something to preempt that inevitable food coma then order the affogato. It's been almost 2 years since Morini opened but expect there to be a big crowd every night so make sure to call ahead for reservations. And if you want a relatively quiet table then request one towards the back and along the wall so as to be away from the flurry of movement to and from the kitchen. Otherwise, come in with friends and family and join in on the revelry of an Italian feast. For more on Michael White check out my posts on Examiner!",9,9,8,9

However, the cafe is a cute little gem across from Central Park, and has a different German/Austrian theme. I had the edelberry syrup with sparkling water, which was refreshing and unique tasting, and a delicious soft pretzel with lots of mustard. My friend got the bratwurst with sourkraut and potatoes, and that was good as well. I also had the hazelnut tart with berries, even though it was hard to choose because they had an entire page of desserts. It was good, even though I must say I've had way better tarts in my lifetime. The downsides are that their menu is a tad bit on the pricey side, and doesn't offer a huge variety of food- mostly just sandwiches and sausages. My tart was $9, and the bratwurst was like $18- but it's understandable given the location. I recommend going to Francois Payard, Bouchon bakery, Lauderee, or Maison Kayser for better desserts.

I hadn't  been in here in a few years, but I had regarded it well before. I went last night with a b-day party, crowded, loud, lots of pretty people- NYC Saturday night! The potato chips with bleu cheese were bland. The bleu cheese sauce tasted more like cream than bleu cheese. Sad face. And the sauce should really be served on the side, not doused into the bottom of the bowl and on the chips, because it's easier to share that way and the chips wouldn't get soggy. I also tried the ""crispy"" fried calamari, which wasn't crispy or particularly good. I then had the mussels- a little over-cooked and the sauce wasn't great, most of it's flavor came from red chili (I think), making it strangely spicy (and the menu didn't mention anything about this element). Others in the group ordered fish, which was reported to be good, and one ordered the rib-eye, reported to be passable but not memorable. Our server was very good though, it should be noted.  However, the bus/runner coordination wasn't good- apps weren't bussed when the entrees arrived, and the runner had no idea what went where (we were a party of seven).   So for the level of food you get, it's a REALLY expensive place. So don't kid yourself about why you're there- it's the scene and the group you're with, knowing you'll spend a lot for so-so food.",4,5,4,5

1432,4018,11,8/27/13,"Lots of mixed reviews; wasn't sure what to expect.  But the menu was delicious and as a vegetarian I was pleasantly suprised to find a lot of good, seasonal veggie dishes on the menu.  The decor is amazing and the place has the vibe of both a neighborhood spot (does everyone here know each other???) and a good place to take out of town friends  you want to impress.  The best part was being able to see into the kitchen--an intimate peek you don't get in a lot of places around here, where you can't tell if your food is being scraped off the floor or what.  The drinks menu is fun and funny, the wine list delish and I'm not going to complain about the prices because each dish was beautifully prepared with lots of delicate touches.  What's great it that is seems like the menu rotates around a few tasty standards (I won't eat it, but the burger looks deeeeelish and juicy, and the french fries are spot-on), but the specials follow the trends in the market.  What that means is that if I go in more than twice a month, I'm still pleasantly suprised by various menu options.  Oh! and the creamy corn dish is to die for.  I could eat that morning, noon and night.",9,8,8,6
1433,6191,451,11/27/13,"This is one of those restaurants that I've walked by so many times, each time looking in and saying ""this place looks great, I need to try it"". For some reason it still took me too long to finally make a reservation.  This place is always packed so unless you're ready to wait it is worth making a reservation ahead of time. The atmosphere (warm, romantic, pretty loud) is perfect for date night or a small group - any bigger and you probably  won't hear each other.  We lucked out and were seated at a table in the back corner tucked away from the main area next the bar. Given its focus on Whiskey, I opted for a whiskey/prosecco cocktail but if you're more adventurous there is a huge Whiskey list from different areas/countries (plus various Whiskey based cocktails and wines).  The menu is relatively small but has a lot of different options ranging from your typical Southern influenced food plus raw and cooked seafood dishes. The complimentary cornbread was a great starter. We really enjoyed our appetizers (crispy grits and country ham) but thought the entrees were amazing. The duck was some of the best we'd ever had - perfectly cooked and so much flavor. Great dining experience altogether with friendly service. Can't wait to come back for dinner/drinks again and to try brunch as well.  Yes, it is a little on the pricier side but overall great option in Flatiron.",8,8,8,6

1437,20264,510,9/21/07,"Cozy spot, great corn, strong drinks, bang for the buck, and would come again at an off-peak time. There is some conflicting corn-related information in the previous reviews here, but I'm certain mayo and chili powder are involved (and maybe cayenne pepper -- definitely a noticeable kick), the slathered mayo being crucial to all that cheese and chili powder and limeyness adhering to the ear. To add to the cheering section: good stuff! And, same price per ear as at the Red Hook Ball Fields, but ever so much more accessible to the slothful Manhattanite. (I followed prior Yelpers' advice about bringing floss. So key to be able to enjoy my corn unfettered by worries about future tooth obstruction!) We had about an hour wait on a Friday night at 8:30, which was tempered by a couple of very potent mojitos. Sopesitas (corn cakes), average. Pechuga de pollo al pipian (chicken in pumpkin and tomatillo mole) was really nicely and subtly flavored. Enchiladas de mole poblano (chicken, chocolate-less mole) was decent, but not too memorable. Entree portions were huge, though, and we rolled ourselves out of that place -- whereupon we paused for 7 minutes and then headed for pudding at Rice to Riches, coffee and aperitifs at Cafe Gitane, and drinks at Shebeen.

My parents and I happened across this place while wondering through the different neighborhoods in Manhattan. Joe's Shanghai is unassuming from the front, but you could see it is bustling on the inside. There seemed to be a fair mix of locals and tourists with large family-style seating. We sat at a round table for ten with two other families, one from the neighborhood, one from Jersey. We ordered pork soup dumplings, because from what we gathered, it's practically law at this place, and we were happy we did. It was the perfect steaming beginning to the meal, especially after walking around in the cold for hours!  We ordered a few standard entrees (beef & broccoli, chicken with plum sauce, and another I can't recall) as well which were very tasty and served in large portions. The service was very friendly and attentive, and they served Fanta by the can.

This is probably not something I will have often, since it's pretty decadent. 2.  shop tots (tater tots) The tater tots were scrumptious, and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Delectable all on it's own without dipping sauce. I would come back for these alone. 3.  truffle mayo (homemade dipping sauce) $0.99 extra - it was yummy, but not sure if it was necessary. I'm glad I tried it though. 4.  creamy red cabbage slaw Not as creamy as I had hoped, but that was probably best (considering all the greasy goodness going on).

I have been to every region in Italy and I can honestly say that Trattoria L'incontro's food is better than any Italian restaurant I have dined at  during those 16 years! The service was first rate. Staff was so friendly and professional. No need to ever open the menu - the specials are never ending and beyond delicious. I still can't believe that this restaurant is a ten minute walk from my apartment. No need to go into Manhattan because this can't be beat! It was also a real pleasure to meet Chef Rocco in person at the end of our meal. Grazie e a presto!,9,7,8,8

This was a simple pizza with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and jalepenos that they turns into something so delicious I can hardly describe it.  The pepperoni is nothing like what you find in California pizzas.  The circles are smaller, cut thicker, and have the most amazing peppery flavor to them.  They start the pizza with sliced mozzerella, then a layer of toppings, and finally the sauce.  Maybe that is the clue to a better pizza. Or, more likely it's the sauce... it was delicious with pieces of basil which added so much extra flavor.  If we ever return to NY, we're definitely returning to Grimaldi's.",8,8,9,8

Happy hour specials are spot on with huge bowls of Mac & cheese made with their own cheese. $5 infused cocktails are also great, as are the drinks on their full menu. It's a great place to hang out with friends, although it's just a tad loud for real conversations. Lots of seating options and I love the atmosphere.",8,8,9,8

The size of their lobster roll is really like half a roll and for $15 a roll, it would take 2 orders to fill me up, even with the combo for chips and drink.

I think this place is ridiculously overpriced. Pork shoulder is  such a cheap meat.. that it doesn't warrant the $200 something price tag that it carries. I also am especially harsh on places that are over-hyped and I think this place is in that category. Do I think it was good? ABSOLUTELY.. I mean how can anything cooked for that long not be good?

Great ingredients, all around a tasty meal. She's gotten different things, often cold soba noodles as it was summer.  Most of the time she's been very happy too, but once she got the Yamakake - it was a nasty slimy pile of yams.  Skip it, get almost anything else here.

First their organization in spite of the fact that the wait time is hours long for a table is on point. They dont play. Secondly, when you are seated there are a flurry of american japanese yelling waiters at your service. Dirty your napkin? BAM new one in ten seconds. Out of water? LIES, that never happens there. The food was nice, the pork bun is hands down best one I've tried, the meat is chock full of flava' and they have some special sauce action going on in there. The ramen itself is nice, I appreciated the kae dama ( more noodles for 2 bucks) option since I found the noodles a bit thin. The chashu pork was good no complaints there. Still I feel like if you are going to charge 13 bucks for ramen which is essentially street food in Japan from what ive heard, you better be doing something special with it. I didnt feel like Ippudos ramen on its own was a game changer, but I can definitely get behind this restaurant as a whole experience.",6,5,8,9

Finding a place that would satisfy my foodie-ness, seat a 14 person party and let us BYOB with NO CORKAGE FEE is incredibly rare! For starters, the food was amazing. The duck breast in port cherry sauce was divine. The goat cheese tart was as good as the reviews have said. The Cassoulet was ridiculously opulent. The overall value here is fantastic, and the service by Christina and Erin was phenomenal. They took care of us all night. Even spoke to the owner, who also was involved enough to reply to my friends review with a personal message addressing his loves and concerns of the evening. Very nice touch. I will return to La Serine for years as long as it remains BYOB. Finding a place this great that does BYOB and plans to stay that way is a rare find indeed.

They will have variations on a steak, roast chicken, a fish, chop and a burger always, but with a seasonal preparation of vegetables. The cocktails are always great and change seasonally. A charm is the delicious piping hot bread they serve which is baked in a terra-cota pot and always brought without asking.

The sides were good. The beer was awesome, but the taste of the burger was too greasy and bad that we couldn't finish it. The buns were soggy. I don't recommend this place at all.",2,2,4,5

Our waiter was dryly funny and cocky in the way a waiter absolutely should be, and made conversation and booze recommendations throughout the night that seriously added to the evening. The evening also involved two tasting menus that made my little heart sing. The complimentary pulled pork taco plus risotto ball amuse-bouche was a great start. The pork belly + watermelon, scallop with thai curry, and glorious duck breast were just fantastic. My companion had a very tasty fish entree, and the rabbit terrine, which was disappointingly similar to tuna fish salad, but it's brand new so I'm sure they'll work on it. My chocolate souffle was just outstanding, and the waiter insisted that I crack into it to pour the creme anglaise myself, saying, ""We're supposed to do that for you, but that's like opening someone's present."" Did I mention I loved our waiter? I couldn't help but trade desserts with my friend halfway through, because his rosemary honey panna cotta just stole my heart. We will be back. Soon.",8,7,9,7

It's your typical Asian sushi rice, but they somehow make it so plump and firm. It's the little things that makes a big difference, and that rice was what impressed me the most, along with the low prices! Good quality food, crazy baseball stuff and Hideki Matsui fandom, funky style decor. Love the originality of the place. Like a very successful fast food joint, except with GOOD FOOD for a change.

WARNING: Watch out for the red sauce - it'll burn your butt off! The Falafel ball was large, fried and in charge. Perfect blend in the middle, with just the right crunch. I recommend mixing one spoonful of the red sauce in the mild white sauce for a nice treat. And... if you're still not sold on Falafel, I took the West Village Tour with ""Sidewalk Tours"" and Mamoun's was one of our first stops.

1488,70421,326,2/27/12,"Have now been here twice, and my wife and I are now looking for more concerts to attend at the small venues nearby so that we can double up with one of our new favorite spots in NYC. First off, right next door to the Bowery Ballroom is an awesome, awesome location. When you first walk in, you notice the place is clean, dimly-lit, and just plain cool. You encounter half of the bar area inside the door, with additional table seating in a couple of differently-styled areas throughout. There are romantic archway seats cut into the brick, open bartop tables, and traditional seats in the back. Even the rest roomsdownstairs have a funky vibe. I really love a place that feels like it wasn't meant to be a commercial venue when it was built. The beer list is excellent, both on draught and bottled. My first time here, I dug deep into my wallet for a bottle of the very rare Brooklyn Black Ops. They also had an Ommegang promo that night, so we got to enjoy a couple of their high-gravity seasonal releases. The food is very interesting - you just have to look up the menu to see what I mean. The prices are probably the best value around. If there's a better bang for the buck, please let me know what it is. It's all delicious, and the flavors pop with each bite, regardless of your selection. This past weekend, we stopped in after a show at Webster Hall, and got to meet the owners. One specializes in craft beer, the other in cocktails, so it's a perfect mix. Before learning the latter was a partner, I kept commenting to my wife that she was the most polite server I had ever encountered. I guess I would be too if I were trying to get a new business off the ground. We really enjoyed chatting it up with both of them. Overall, even with a 45 minute drive and an expensive bridge toll. I'd say this rates on our list of destination locations, not just a convenient stop along the way to somewhere else.",9,5,8,2

1490,52091,211,12/12/14,"Dare I say it.......... best pizza of my life?...... damn I dunno if I can ever make such a bold statement about any one type of food, but I just wanna say for now.... it's possibly the best. It could be. It may very well be. THE CRAB PIZZA. Whoa................ I don't want to describe it for you guys, but I want everyone who has the chance to, to TRY IT. Don't anticipate anything (as I had no idea what it would be like) and just... enjoy. I didn't think I would like this one as much as I do but man................. this pizza is so good. My number 1. (IMPORTANT NOTE: my bf doesn't like/eat seafood but he thought the crab pizza was fantabulous.) The artichoke pizza's a very VERY VEERY close second. I expected it to be my fave. I mean, the place is named after that pizza! And I LOVE artichoke, grilled, as a dip, or whatever. Never seen it on a pizza before, although it is a definitely a stroke of genius since it goes so well with cream & cheese. HELLOOOO other pizza joints, why is this not more common? But anyway... the artichoke pizza is SOO GOOD TOO!!! It's like artichoke dip, but a more sophisticated & delicate version of it, on a pizza. It seems like such an obvious way to go, but so far...... can't find it anywhere else lol. I think I prefer the crab pizza more because the artichoke one is a bit heavier. Like, it's literally heavy because of the cream, cheese, spinach, & artichokes. And I think that's why they need to have a thicker crust, so it can actually hold and not collapse as you eat it. Physics. I prefer thin crust, so the crab was like.. perfect. But honestly, both are extremely tasty as far as pizzas go. Also, slices are huge. 1.5 slices is perfect for me lol. I read in reviews that the place is small.... but it was MINISCULE. We went on a rainy night, and there were like maybe 7 customers, and we were just jammed up together like septuplets in a womb (I had to look up that term for 7). And it was raining so nobody wanted to go outside lol. ANYWAY, that don't change a thing.

The meal was perfect (I ordered the gluten free gnocchi) and the service was very attentive and on point. Not five stars, because the server charged us for an appetizer we didn't order and told us that a couple before us who looked just like us ordered that appetizer and he got confused.

The overwhelmingly positive reviews (and proximity to Grand Central station) made us choose to try it for the first time and spend our NYE there. I'm really glad we did! We arrived early for our 9:45 so we got some drinks at the bar. Our bartender John was great, he even made a custom old-fashioned for my husband. Our prix fixe dinner was absolutely delicious, I could see my husband's face light up with each course and hear all the MMMMMs with each bite. He crudo, risotto and lamb for his dinner. I had fried foie gras, pasta with lobster and duck for mine. The amuse-bouche was three yummy bites of crostini, pork taco and fried shrimp. The dessert was a deconstructed s'more and champagne cake, which were good. There was a bonus glitter-dusted chocolate box with several little chocolate treats inside, so sweet! The meal was luxurious and seriously delicious. That said, the most yummy were the bread rolls topped with duck fat and sea salt. We had to get a second order. I drool every time I think about them. The service was efficient for New Year's Eve and our waiter very friendly and attentive. After the champagne toast at midnight, the kitchen staff came out banging pots and pans in celebration. We all cheered. Post-dinner, the husband and I went back to the bar to finish our drinks and join some of the other diners & staff singing along to the music choices of the hostess. :) For the exceptional standard of food and the relaxed, fun atmosphere- I couldn't have asked for a better experience.

The reason the tentacles keep moving is that they don't just have more nerve endings than a human sex organ, they also function as taste buds and contain neurons - parts of the octopus's brain. The head of the octopus is aware that you are maiming and eating it. How would you like it if some bored food tourist cut off your arms, legs and dick / clit and ate them in front of you while you were dying and trying to escape? Kill the damn octopus first.

Ramen - I tried the classic and modern and daily specials. I never like the modern or the specials. So the last few visit I got myself classic. I noted the broth doesn't taste consistent, sometimes it's perfectly right, sometimes it's too salty, sometimes too much butter was added so it's too greasy. Noodles too - always fresh, but sometimes its too hard/too soft. Toppings... er, average. the cha siu though, could use meat that has more fat.

Spicy Meat Sauce 1) Cook the onions and pork with the olive oil, chili and salt over a medium heat in a large pot , stirring constantly until the meat is thoroughly cooked and the onions are soft and begin to brown (about 15 minutes). 2) Add the tomato paste and cook for five minutes. 3) Add the canned tomatoes and stir constantly until sauce begins to boil. 4) Continue cooking for 35 minutes, stirring every four or five minutes so that the sauce does not burn.",9,1,7,4

This drink was interesting... the passion fruit juice was tart & it didn't mask the dryness of the infused vodka quite well. We all tried their restaurant week menu.  The Restaurant Week Menu offered 2 tapas-style appetizers, a main entree, & a dessert: Appetizers: I ordered Baba Ganoush (eggplant dip) & Black Iron Shrimp (shrimp saut√©ed with cilantro, jalapeno, and garlic in a mini cast iron skillet).  The shrimp was very savory.  The dip was good... loved that the pita bread was served warm. I got the pink peppercorn crusted Black cod as the main entree.  The portion was a bit small and it was a tad salty though. Dessert: I ordered the traditional Lebanese dessert: Achta: a traditional Lebanese dessert with bananas, chopped nuts sprinkled on top with simple syrup which had lavender or some kind of floral essence in it.   It was way too sweet for me, only had 2 spoonfuls and I was done.  My friends loved it though... they have more of a sweet tooth and helped me finish it off. Service was quite attentive.

In general, good sized portions - not too big, not too small. Two of us usually share 2 apps an entree, and a dessert at restaurants like this (nicer, but not too expensive) and sometimes leave totally completely stuffed, which is not the best feeling. However, portion sizes were great here. Appetizers - Red Snapper Ceviche - maybe the best dish we had, great flavor, very fresh Goat Cheese Gnocchi - Tasty, but a little heavy. Very large serving for one person for an appetizer. Entree - Crispy Duck Breast. Again, solid, but not amazing. A little overcooked (asked for medium rare) and not too crispy, but not bad. Dessert - Rhubarb Puff Pastry - came with delicious orange home-made ice cream. That was excellent. Overall very tasty. Also, a good wine selection that wasn't too pricey. Yes, we'll probably go back eventually, especially when the season changes to see a different menu.

Some suggestions: -scrap the food comes as food is ready thing. 1 person at my table got and finished both his app and entree before anyone else got a bite of food. Was awkward for him and us (we were all starving) -i wouldn't call it family style. There's nothing about a meatball sandwich that is easy to share with a big table. -lighten up the fare just a pinch! I know it's supposed to be heavy but it's REEAAAAAAALLLY Heavy, like coma inducing, sleep til noon the next day heavy. Maybe a pinch less butter and oil and salt? Mayyyybe? Other than that I think this place has some great stuff. Short rib was delicious and giant (that should be called ""for two""), the drinks were well made and by a friendly guy. Atmosphere feels new and doesn't have a ton of character but I'm willing to look past that. My friend at the table summed it up perfectly by saying ""If this place was within 2-4 blocks of me I'd go a fair amount, but it's not a destination restaurant worth traveling to"" Fair enough. I'll be back again.",5,2,4,3
1519,22130,72,12/28/11,"I think the only reason this place gets good reviews is because there just aren't that many ramen places in midtown (although I'm going to try Sapporo and see if that's any better). It's worth going down to the Village though and checking out the ramen places there (Momofuku Noodle bar was delicious!), they've never failed me! It's a C rating, it's a little saltier than I like and the wait really just isn't worth it.",6,6,7,5
1520,27372,837,8/13/12,"Came here after the museum on a Friday night and liked it alot. A welcome change from the usual UES choices: personality-less glossy restaurants, sushi joints, or hovel-like dive bar options. This place is homey and cute, and the food is delicious. It's deceptively big - so there wasn't a wait on a Friday night at 9PM?! Yes! I had the signature dish which is ricotta gnocchi with black truffle and chive. It was incredible. The wine selection is solid, the appetizer selection was fantastic (we went with the veal mini meatballs, they were awesome). The dessert selection was INCREDIBLE. They had three options involving Nutella, so I'm pretty much sold. I'm deducting one star because of three small issues a) our waiter was a cold turd. His personality really detracted from the overall experience. b) it's 15% more expensive than it really needs to be, even for NYC. c) it's on the UES so the clientele is 20% more obnoxious than anywhere else in the city.",8,7,7,6

This place is small and has about 7 tables inside and 2 tables outside, so get here early. The empanadas are awesome with the right amount of dough to filling ratio. I came here with 3 other friends and we ordered a handful of empanadas and decided to share them. I would recommend getting the spicy chicken and the viagra (seafood). I will definitely be back. Also try the plantain chips with guac for an appetizer.",8,6,9,7
1524,54166,643,7/12/13,"1 star for decor, 1 star for service, 1 star for appetizers and wide selection of wine.   For appetizers my friends and I shared the Vendure, Cipollotti, and the Carpaccio Di Manzo. Cooked to perfection. For our entrees we had the Stozzapreti con Seppie, a special pasta, and the Pollo Al Girarrosto. All three dishes were cooked/roasted and plated to perfection but the sauce and seasoning was overwhelming. It was too spicy and too salty. There was no where to go for relief because all of the dish's accompaniments were also overzealously  seasoned. It was such a shame. The food looked wonderful, but my friends and I should not have to cling to our waters to eat it.",3,7,1,6
1525,51484,401,5/16/10,"What first resembles a throwback movie theatre playing silent films is definitely worth exploring further. The low-lit interior and French American fare wafting throughout the restaurant had me captivated. After a delicious cucumber cocktail at the bar I sat down with friends for dinner. The crisp, refreshing taste of a blend of Hendricks gin, cucumber, and dimmi whet my appetite for the oysters special. The oysters were succulent and extremely off-the-boat fresh. As my main course, I stuck with the seafaring motif and ordered the pan seared dorade special on a bed of corn salsa and ramps. I had never had ramps before, but since Jean Georges has an affinity for them I decided to follow suit. They were delightful, as was the meaty texture of the dorade (similar to that of sea bass). After a second round of cucumber martinis it was time for dessert. Nothing like the nostalgic quality of doughnuts to cap things off. There were as light as air yet sugared to perfection. Keith McNally has definitely figured out the recipe for success. Bon Courage!",9,7,6,5
1526,6664,859,8/17/12,"Ahh...one of my fav place in the city, i've been going there the past 4-5 years. What can i say... it's great yakitori. People say the place has dipped a little but i still think is plenty good. The seating is a bit tight, there usually is a wait (almost always). This isn't st marks. Yes, it is probably double the price, but it's worth it. The ingredients and preparation i think is better here (not to say i'm looking down on St marks, i would never pass down cheap booze and izakayas) I usually order EVERYTHING. I think you will get a much better experience if you stay away from just white meat chicken stuff and go for things like gizzards. beef tongue, liver, hearts, i'm getting hungry as i'm typing this..... the pork (both w/ scallions & mustard are great.. the rice balls are yum. More appetizers... last's see... wasabi marinated raw octopus.... agedashi tofu... yum.... fried small silver fish... for rice, i always get chicken & egg over rice (go with raw egg). Wash it down with a cold japanese beer or one of their shochu drinks. I know it sounds ridiculous after describing all this but DEFINITELY save room to have their green tea ice cream....

1527,71184,780,7/8/13,"Medium-sized place in Chinatown with a no-frills dining style.  You basically sit with other people at tables with hard seats and have to decide if you want to eat with chopsticks or forks.  The food is ok, it's not wonderful and it's not horrible.  The beef and broccoli is basic and the lo mein is not the usual kind you would find in take-out places.  Again, it was just barely ok. Maybe it's me but when I saw the ducks and chickens hanging in the windows, I immediately felt a little sick.  It didn't help that it happened to be 93 degrees when I came here with a couple of friends but that sight has always been somewhat unsettling to me.  Don't get me wrong, I've seen plenty of meat before, as my father has been a butcher for over forty years.  It's just that I don't like the idea of food hanging on hooks in plain view and out in the open. Yeah, it's cheap and they only take cash, so there's that.  Would I come here again?  Only if I was absolutely starving and dragged in by my friend, who really likes it a lot.  Even then, I would try to play along but I'm pretty sure this would never be a regular spot for me.",3,6,2,7
1528,126408,654,9/10/10,"I really wanted to like Go! Go! Curry! more because it seems very authentic Japenese.  I love eating and making Japanese curry but for some reason, I just did not like their curry that much.  It was good but not that good.  I like the Japanese curry more at the little eatery inside the Yagura Japanese Market on E. 41st Street near Bryant Park and Grand Central.   However, for the price that I paid, I found that the portion was large.  I got curry over rice with shrimp tempura and a boiled egg.  I was not a fan of the shrimp tempura but the addition of the egg helped me enjoy my dish more.  My boyfriend got curry over rice with chicken cutlet.  Both dishes had a side of cabbage.  My boyfriend really liked his entree and he would give this place at least four stars.  I did like his fried chicken cutlet though.   I will definitely try this place again because my boyfriend really like the curry here.  He is sad that I am only giving this place three stars.  Maybe I will like the curry more next time I eat here.",4,8,6,8
1529,5948,16,3/9/11,"It's probably a good thing I see my homeboy VV only once a month; if we were to spend any more time together, we would be 500 pound alcoholics. As it is, he's already sporting a tie clip and a sweater vest, and me, I'm just doing my best Minnie Mouse impression. So the secret fatty crew had their monthly meet up at Maialino. Service, as is to be expected from a Danny Meyer establishment, was stellar - friendly, helpful and not at all intrusive or awkward. Like, when I asked to have my drink tab at Vandaag transferred from the bar to my table, the bartender rolled his eyes like marbles. Really? Fuck you, dickface. Here, the bartender cheerfully nodded, and the man escorting us to our table said to him, ""22."" Look how fucking easy that is, man. The menu's offerings are rustic Roman, simple but well executed. I went in knowing we were going to have the heart stopping maialino (roast pig), and our server was quick to suggest other items and subtly insisted that I was ordering too much food. WHAT? No. It's never too much. - fried artichokes w/ anchovy dipping sauce. God, the beautiful sweetness of an artichoke heart makes me want to cry. Or, just eat it. - raviolo con uovo. Here's a big fat disk of pasta stuffed with cheese, spinach & holy cow, is that a golden, runny, decadent egg yolk oozing out? Yes it is! - maialino for 2. Big, thick slabs of roast pork skin, glistening and shattering beneath the knife, accompanied by perfectly seasoned meat and browned roasted potatoes. Every bite was perfumed with rosemary. Holy god. VV gave me most of the skin. I should have given him a beej as a thanks. - tempura fried mixed vegetables. Light, crisp assortment including heirloom carrots, fennel & cauliflower Because this simply wasn't enough, halfway through, I asked the server to bring us - taglioni nero, black squid ink pasta. Murky, sinister and heavily flavored with the sea as it was tossed with bottarga. So good. The kitchen sent out a complimentary side of sauteed spinach w/ garlic, lemon & olive oil. Oh, look - healthy. (We ate it anyway) As VV works in the restaurant industry, we were comped a few glasses of wine which were selected for us by the beverage director (a very charming lady with a sassy set of spectacles) to accompany the uovo, the maialino and the taglioni specifically. Three glasses of wine for three dishes. Never mind I was already two Lambruscos in. Needing something tart to cleanse our palates, we opted to share a sformato topped with strawberry and uh, at this point, I was drunk, so maybe that was rhubarb. I shouldn't have asked for a Montenegro because it tastes like old people and cologne. Financial damage: starters and sides are in the 12-18$ range black squid ink pasta was 23$ raviolo: i forget, but say 15$ maialino for 2: 45$ So dinner for two, if you eat like you want to gain 300lbs overnight, coupled with drinks, will run about 300$ (including tax/tip). On the way out, the man who led us to our table inquired as to how we enjoyed our meal and we beamed happily. He went on to rhapsodize about his birthday dinner there with this dreamy smile. It only further proves just how amazing Danny Meyer is, and his skill in treating both guest and employee like precious gems. This is a rarity, and such hospitality ensures repeat visits.

1531,42650,366,9/27/14,"Somehow I came to this place twice within a two week span, which I actually loathe doing. This is New York, and I should eat in different places. But it did give me a nice perspective on the menu items. First time, came for brunch, waited in heat that would rival the fires of hades for over an hour, and then finally sat next to one of ""those couples"" that was unhappy with everything and just all around unpleasant. Not off to a fabulous start. Had the burger covered with 3048509283490238 pickles and what seemed like 3 lbs of meat. Hot sweaty mess me couldn't handle all of this and didn't really enjoy myself. Round two was so much better. Went for a friends New York Anniversary and 6 of us got seated almost right away at 8 on a Thursday- stupendous. I had the southern fried BLT and holy rollers was it exceptional. Fried green tomato, fried chicken and cole slaw. YUM. Fried chicken and pancakes was also a big hit at this celebration and those were a little slice of fluffy goodness. The rosemary lemonade was tasty as well as the jam jar. Both really felt like a serious hangover would be coming if you drank more than one due to the sheer level of sweetness. Overall, skip this place if the temperature gauge is resting on blazing heat for the day and you can't make a reservation, but check it out at night or during a crisp fall day! Pro tip: bring a flashlight at night because even 6 20somethings couldn't read the menu in the dark.",7,9,8,8

1533,97754,316,1/3/14,"I came in with a few friends on New Year's Eve for dinner and left in a good mood. There was a nice beer selection. Anticipating all of the snacks that would be around for the rest of the evening, I ordered a ""mini burger"" off of the kid's menu. The burger was very small and came on an English muffin, but it was very tasty. (I ordered mine with cheddar.) It came with fries, but since this was the kid's menu I only got three steak fries (if I was an actual kid, I'd be pretty cranky about this.) Two friends got the regular sized grass-fed burger and seemed pretty happy with their choices. Another friend ordered the mac and cheese and was very happy with it- she said it was delicious. My last friend got the mussels, which looked and smelled amazing. Overall, it was a pretty solid choice. It was a nice, relaxed neighborhood bar. The only real problem was price relative to size and the fact that the waitress seemed to forget about us after a while-- we felt like we were waiting too long for the check. One of my friends actually ended up getting up and talking to another staffer (not our waitress...) in order to get the check. Still- pleasant experience overall!",8,5,9,3

1535,1913,908,2/10/14,"Loved Ngam the first time (probably just due to the novelty of a woody, cozy Thai restaurant that uses locally/sustainably sourced ingredients) but have had very meh experiences on subsequent visits.Cocktail menu is very interesting and drinks are solidly made-- some favorites include the East Villager (gin, fresh ginger, lemongrass, ginger ale) and the Below the Root (tequila, basil, ginger syrup, ginger ale). Happy hour special makes cocktails all the more sweet. Service is also always reliably attentive and prompt. Unfortunately, the food is pretty mediocre and the tight seating space make Ngam a 3 star experience. Of the items I've tried, the pad see ewe was probably the best-tasting-- and by that, I mean it's on par with pretty much any other standard Thai restaurant in the city. On my most recent visit, we ordered the pad see ewe with beef-- and the beef tasted very off-- there was a gamey, perhaps even ever so slightly sour taste to it that is not at all common in beef. The meat to noodles proportion was also off-- too much gamey beef and not enough greasy noodles. We also ordered the Cutie Duckling ""Ghang Ped Bhed Yang"" (roasted Long Island duck, homemade ""ghang ped"" curry, lychee, heirloom tomatoes, Thai basil sauce)-- which sounds amazing, but was not at all worth its $28 price tag. The duck was way over-cooked-- blasphemous considering it was a duckling. Everything else about it- the curry, lychee, etc.- was fine-- but none of it could overcome the overcooked duck(ling). The apps here are decent but nothing special. The shiitake mushroom spring rolls that everyone raves about is pretty standard deep fried spring roll fare. The papaya salad is refreshing- though a bit heavy on the lime and tamarind dressing. Finally, the last downside of Ngam is the tight seating situation. The small tables (for parties of 2-4) are way too close to each other. The one large communal table is a nice use of that otherwise dead center space-- but again, the seats are far too close to each other. I get the premium on space, but it comes at the cost of being right up in the face of strangers and a less than comfortable dining experience. Oh and the final final thing-- I noticed on my last visit that the restrooms are not heated... making Ngam authentically Asian in a undesirable way!",2,7,3,9
1536,132323,690,6/9/14,This is a review I should have posted a couple of years ago. Because I was born and raised in Texas I am a harsh critic when it comes to any food remotely considered Mexican or Tex-Mex. I still haven't found a go-to Mexican spot in NYC. It's like searching for the Holy Grail. I like Gueros. It is good for Brooklyn. I wish the place was a bit larger but they serve flavorful tacos and are in walking distance of my house. Score! Today I had a bloody Maria while I waited for my order. Great spice although not enough alcohol. The avocado and jalepeno taco is by far my favorite. Today they weren't as good as they normally are. I'm not sure if that means they are falling off or just having an off day. I will still patronize Gueros and just assume they are having an off day.,6,5,7,4

I used Yelp to find a cheap eats spot between the Fashion District and Union Square. Surprisingly, Johny's does offer a ton of healthy alternatives. They have tossed salads with chicken (ooh look at the heros getting toasted), pita pizzas with all kinds of toppings (yum, that must be like 40 strips of bacon browning), and I chose an egg white and vegetable wheat wrap w/o cheese (someone just ordered cheesesteaks to go? sounds deliciouso!). That and my friend got a bacon and egg sandwich with fries, plus my wrap and a soda = $12. Better than your average diner food and the staff have a ton of personality.

It's large and spacious, dimly lit, with a general Thai decor. I've also ordered take-out a few times. Delivery is fast! Ordering in at the office for lunch also does not seem bad at all - given the $7 lunch special they run. Be sure to pick up one of their pamphlets when you're leaving the restaurant.

The oysters...i think we are going to die. Tasted like rancid bad. I really think we might die. 2.Entrees- Me: had the Paella which was a repeat of the appetizer but a little saltier and seemed as though it had festered in the sun for a while.

1557,29270,468,3/1/11,"I was kinda conflicted when trying to rate Joe's Shanghai.  If I could, I'd give it 4.5 stars...5 for the soup dumplings, but .5 deduction for bad service.  Normally, I'm not one to deduct for non-food related stuff (especially cuz what's the point of food...it's to eat it), but the combination of all the bad service-related issues plus the other so-so dishes on the menu, I ended up giving it 4 stars. Let me start with the soup dumplings.  I'm from LA, so I've tried Din Tai Fung (the west coast contender for best XLB), but in my opinion, Joe's has, hands down, the BEST soup dumplings ever.  Every time I visit NY, I HAVE to have at least one meal at Joe's...even if it means waiting an hour to get one order of soup dumplings to eat as a appetizer before heading over to another restaurant for an entree and dessert.  The skin is perfectly thin and chewy, while the soup inside is so savory, you can't get enough of the soupy deliciousness. For those who had tried other XLB places, here is how I think they compare.  Din Tai Fung - Joe's soup dumplings are way bigger, plumper, tastier, and cheaper.  Winner in all categories (except for atmosphere...DTF is way cleaner and presentable as a restaurant).  Shanghai Cafe - The skin is way too thick and doughy for my taste, but the inside does taste cleaner (not as greasy).   Finally, let me touch upon why I ultimately gave Joe's Shanghai 4 stars instead of 5. On Yelp, their business hours are listed as being open everyday until 11pm, so imagine our surprise when we got there at 9pm, and they practically shooed us out of there saying that they were closed (the place was about 3/4 full with people still eating).  How rude!   And just a heads up - when you're paying, the bill they give you already includes a 15% tip (regardless of the size of your party).",5,6,4,6

Mac and cheese was runny and not very flavorful. Collard greens were soggy. Baked beans were pretty good, but not worth going back for. We were excited for dessert, but were disappointed by the three options we tried. The lemon chess pie was the best of the three, but way too sweet. The bourbon pecan pie was ok, and the smores pie tasted like an artificial chemical was added to give it a ""campfire burn"" taste. Service was friendly, but took a long time. Two of us ordered catfish, but we were brought chicken after a 30 minute wait. Server apologized, but ""swore"" we both ordered chicken. Won't be going back.",3,4,1,5

If I go to a restaurant more than once in a city when I have millions of other places to go to, that means I looooove their food. I'm actually dying to go back soon, hopefully this week :) So far I've tried their: 1Caprine bruschetta 2Caciotta al tartuffo cheese 3Robiola cheese 4Bigoletti Di barbaietole (beet gnocchi) 5Brodetto Di pesce (like a seafood gumbo) 6Petto D'anatra (duck) 7some Nutella dessert that I cannot remember (Oh gosh typing these names are brutal) #4 was very cheesy and had a great gnocchi texture. I think it was made with ricotta, not potato, but check that first. The dish will get kind of boring when you're half way through but I guess that's what most gnocchis are like. It's on this bland side because of the beets. I ordered #5 twice. Which means the dish was ridiculous lol I'm not the biggest seafood fan so you know what I mean by ridiculous. #6 got split opinions with my frid. My frid thought it was the best food of the night but I thought it had a funky smell to it. The spinach and Veges coming with the duck neutralized the weird smell however. Other than the smell, the texture, presentation, flavor and everything else was good so I would still recommend it. I'm sorry I don't know the name of the Nutella dessert because I thought I was in heaven until that plate was fully devoured. There's only one Nutella dessert though (they may change the dessert menus too) so definitely ask for it if you like chocolate and Nutella. Uva is my go-to-Italian-spot in the UES.",7,7,9,9
1562,42870,710,10/12/11,"Had heard good things about this place for a while, and being that my bar boys and I were looking for a place that was off the grid, we decided to go here.   This place is Americana gorgeous, the service on the other hand was atrocious.  I'm a bartender, have been for 15 years or so, so I know I can be picky, but this was absurd. We settled in at the bar on a Sunday evening, not busy.  The bartender acknowledged us and pointed out two seats at the bar (which there were plenty).  Perhaps 8 minutes went by before he came to us for drinks, he was engrossed in a story with another bar patron (standing next to me) at this time.  Once he finally came over, he asked us what we would like, only to cut us off and say ""hold on a minute, I need to refill my energy juice.""  After waiting for his story to finish, after waiting to be served, the bartender pours himself a half pint which he promptly drinks and finishes in front of us, before returning his attention.   Finally, he takes our order, barking out what we should have instead of what we are asking for, or asking how something tastes.  And this is not done in a polite ""oh you like this, then maybe you would like this..."" instead it was a pompous ""you should drink this instead, that tastes like.."" Strike one, two and three.  Our joiner promptly showed up, and the bartender walked away from him, only to return 10 minutes later.  We asked for his drink, asked for the tab 3 times before being able to procure it, finished our drinks and left. I'm willing to give this place another go because of the ambiance, but I will not go back if this bartender is there, in fact, I won't go anywhere he is behind the bar or working.   As a side note, I was willing to let slide most of his service because it seemed like he was the only one working the entire place (tables, and bar), but then as we were about to leave I realized that the Asian woman at the bar was actually the server, yet she had been seated and drinking with her back turned towards the clientele for the duration of our trip to the Post Office.

The hummous was really underwhelming--it was creamy...enough, but not flavorful enough, but overall, it just wasn't that good.

I went in and there were so many delicious-sounding choices on the menu, it was only my gluten intolerance that steered my decisions.  When I asked specifically what was g-free, the hostess was super-helpful and went back to the chef a couple times to make sure I would not get glutened.  After deciding on the scallops with carrot puree and truffled corn salsa, and the shrimp with grits and bacon with poached egg (no sauce makes it g-free), I was heading out the door with my takeout bag in about 10 minutes.   The sturdy brown boxes held some of  the most delicious takeout I've ever had.  The scallops were fresh and delightfully spiced, perfectly paired with the mousse-like carrot puree and the coarse textured corn salad.  The shrimp was likewise fresh and flavorful but the cheesy grits with crispy bacon squares along with the perfectly poached egg sent this dish over the top.  I was not ""full"" but the food was so delicious I was very satisfied and still had room for dessert (which I deferred).  I will definitely return when I'm back in the neighborhood.",9,7,7,6

I will say that I've had better, but the noodles, they were great. Also the amount of food you're getting is pretty solid for the price you pay, Nevertheless, the meat isn't the best and the broth's flavor isn't the most amazing.

1577,15035,93,12/20/11,"My first and most likely last experience at this restaurant was last Saturday for a friend's birthday; a party of 8.  Whatever other yelpers here who said this place is good for groups must have either had smaller groups or gone on a slow night.   They sat 8 people at three small 2-person tables, with one long bench on one side.  This setup should have barely fit 6 people comfortably.  But since we were there to celebrate, nobody wanted to pout.  Personally, this was fine when I was in college, but as an adult it's ridiculous and just makes for a terrible dining experience no matter how good the cuisine.   Drink orders were taken quickly but food orders took upwards of 20 minutes.  The apps were uninspired but the entrees received mostly positive reviews (I had the steak, which I enjoyed; others had the fish which they also enjoyed).  When we ordered coffee and desserts, as our waitress was handing out our coffees she became engrossed in a conversation with another waitress about some personal drama and stood there for a good minute -in front of our table- finishing her story instead of just handing me my damn coffee...you know, the one I'm paying for which apparently isn't enough of a priority for her.  Only after she was done telling her story and the other waitress walked away did she finally hand me my coffee.  I find that sort of service completely unacceptable on a busy Saturday evening.   When it came to pay the check we gave a mix of cards and cash, something I dread, anticipating I'll have to explain basic math.  To an adult.  The cash paying folks only had big bills which required change.  Remember, we had a party of 8, so gratuity was already included.  When the bill came back to us, we only received the receipts to sign for the cards, but no cash change.  We had to flag her down and ask about the cash to which she (in my opinion) played stupid and ""wasn't sure"" there was supposed to be any change.  I simply smiled and kindly told here we were expecting change. As she walked away, all sorts of swear words and insults entered my mind but I bit my tongue until after we left our friends and were in the comfort of our car.   If I had been here with just my girlfriend or a smaller group, to be fair this place seems like it has potential to have an intimate and cozy charm.  And even though the food was decent, I had a difficult time enjoying it because of the crappy space provided to us and the even worse wait service.  I can't justify giving more than one star to an establishment who doesn't hire/train customer service-oriented people or staff people who think it's okay to try and steal their customers' change.

Shanghai crab soup dumplings is what they are famous for, and they are just unbelieveble!!!! Juicy, sweet with vinegar... I'm sure these dumplings are made by skilled chef because the dumplings are filled with soup(the thin kind but tastes absolutely amazing!) and they do not break at all although the skin of the dumplings are very very thin. I simply could not stop eating those dumplings!!! We also had the famous Shanghai style handmade stir fry noodles. The noodles were chewy to perfection! Sort of like duram texture and the soy sauce did not overpower as the traditional ones would. Better than the ones I've had in Hong Kong. Green onion pancakes were flaky and buttery as they are supposed to. Also had the stir fry Shanghai rice cakes with beef, pretty good but just like any other decent Shanghai restaurants.

Nota Bene: this is not really a romantic date kinda place. If that is your idea, go to Agnanti - also a very admirable restaurant but quieter.

According to one of the waiters I was told the branzino was the real levraki and their 'levraki' was american sea bass.

Well, was the food at least mind blowingly good? Average. It didn't blow my taste buds away. So what did we order? I came with 2 other friends, and we ordered papaya salad with crispy catfish meat, red curry with chicken, drunken noodles with minced beef, and lychee ice cream.   First off, paying an extra $3 for the catfish meat was not worth it. It tasted like fried oily noodles. You would be better off with the $7 salad. The salad was good, but it was kinda salty. The dressing tasted like that clearish orangey sauce that you get at Viet restaurants. It was quite spicy, since we ordered it on the spicy side. The drunken noodles was pretty good, but it was very small for something that was $8.50. And it wasn't like it was loaded with meat and veggies. There was hardly any meat at all, but the basil really made the dish taste good. It seemed like they added a lot of sugar too. The curry was very small too. It wasn't very memorable. The ice cream was good, and tasted like lychee, but $4.50 from $6-$7 bucket that they scoop out of?! (I doubt they make their own ice cream, and I'm just assuming the price that they probably bought it for). Insane. If you think about it, they make a lot of money. The profit margin is high for what they give you! Overall, you're not really getting a good deal on the food. Very little meat, and portions quite small to what I'm used to.

You know when things are basically spicy for the sake of being spicy and not because they taste better that way.  --This is not that.   The Totto Spicy Ramen is great.

Having tried most of the menu, I can say that the food is consistently perfection, with a reasonably priced wine list (especially by NYC standards). What really makes this place stand out is the service. I have walked in without a reservation during prime hours and Jacques (manager? owner?) always does his best to find us a table or a seat at the bar. Also, if you have a reservation and you are kept waiting (it is ALWAYS packed), the staff will bring you complimentary champagne while you wait. I also love that you never feel rushed. I have always had an intimate dining experience, and the waiters are really on top of their game. They take their time to explain the menu and wine list and they generally make time for some light conversation.

He was two minutes late, but I'm rounding down :P    A little pricey; I would say it's just a tad bit above the line of what I'd be willing to pay for this quality of meal... but overall, a good experience.

Really, this place seems like it would be great for any occasion. The food is amazing. And portions are more for 2 people than one (in my opinion). Was able to take home some left overs.

I also appreciate that the food came out super fast. The food was mehhh - I had a veggie tofu curry. The curry was on the thin side and the flavors didn't quite penetrate into the veggies and the tofu so it felt a little more like veggies dipped in curry soup rather than a thai curry.

The ramen is expensive ($14-17) but delicious.  I had the Akamaru Modern - a giant bowl of mild but richly flavorful broth with roast pork and a heap of miso paste.  The pork must have been roast pork belly - it was so tender, succulent, and rich, without being too fatty.  Yum. I also love the GIANT spoons that come with the ramen - they were about 3 inches in diameter, had a hook at the end of the spoon to prevent the ramen from sliding into the bowl, and your spoon came with its very own spoonrest.   The pork buns were very good, but not as good as Momofuku's.  The pork belly was deliciously tender, but I missed the sweet hoison and pickled cucumber, and I could swear the buns were less soft and delicate. That said, still delicious.

But when we got there, they didn't have our reservations and we didn't have a private room. They had to scramble around to push tables together for us - we were so cramped that some of the group had to stand and eat.

The menu is large enough to leave you wondering what the best option is.  For a good greasy breakfast- try the malawach- which gives a huge fried dough and a delicious light salad to compliment your breakfast eggs. Perfect for a slight hangover!

1619,17149,549,7/16/12,"Neighborhood hot spot, great brunch! Came here last weekend to meet up with some friends. We just happened on the spot by chance and boy did we get lucky! Upon entering, I thought I was entering the world's coolest flea market. The interior is like another world, with eclectic wall decorations and so many different types of overhead lights. Just being in the hustle and bustle of the restaurant was a five-star experience for me. The way they seat people is fun and efficient. You just give your party number and they tell you they'll put a certain colored handkerchief when a table opens up. Ordering is done at the front, you pay for your order, and find the table they've reserved for you. The line was a little long, but given it was a Sunday afternoon. However, our food came out shortly after ordering. Their menu is HUGE. They offer sandwiches, burgers, a couple entree options, lots of breakfast choices, and a large assortment of drinks, including coffees, tea, and beers on tap! I went with the Grey Dog's Breakfast (french toast, bacon, home fries, eggs any style). My friends got the omelet and the #7 (turkey, apple, and brie sandwich). The price is a little high for brunch, but the portions are big. My french toast was served with a good helping of bananas, blueberries, and strawberries. It was seasoned pretty well, with delicious hints of cinnamon. Only note is that it could have been cooked so it was a little easier to cut. I make the mistake at home as well, cooking it too tough. The real prize of the platter were the home fries. I have absolutely no idea how they cooked it, but they were perfection. They were seasoned perfectly, and were crispy WITHOUT being dry. Biting into each piece of potato was a light crisp followed by what felt like a cloud. The potato was actually fluffy underneath that thin layer of toasty-ness. By far, one of the best home fries I have ever had in my life. I'm still in awe at how well they made it. This technique translates to their sweet potato fries, which my friend got with her sandwich. Heaven. Best sweet potato fries I have ever eaten in my life. They were soooo good, so crispy, but so fluffy and easy to bite into. And many fries lose their body when fried, but the sweet potato meat was still there. Lightly salted, I could eat these fries forever, no joke. They were incredible. The sandwich was also pretty tasty, humongous for the price, although it could've used a little more brie. The omelet was just an omelet, nothing to rave or complain about. So glad to have discovered this spot. The staff was very friendly, the food was so simple but mind-blowing delicious, and the atmosphere is one-of-a-kind. This place is definitely worth whatever trip you have to make to get here. Pros: atmosphere/interior, service, food/cooking quality Cons: pricey (but large portions), loud music, could be long wait for table Dishes to try: sweet potato fries, home fries",6,6,7,8
1620,69638,753,3/8/13,"I have been waiting to try this place for a while now and was thrilled by our experience.  I am not going to lie, I had a few drinks prior to dinner so that may or may not have skewed my thoughts a bit, but I am pretty sure that it didn't.  I went with three other friends around 9pm on a Wednseday night, the wait was only 15 minutes so we waited at the bar and had some more wine of course.  We were then seated at a nice hidden ""alcove"" I want to call it, facing the  open kitchen, it was nice.  We were all extremely hungry by now, so we immediately started with a few appetizers, the carmelized onion flatbread and the pork sticky buns.  The flatbread was good, not too special, but the pork sticky buns were definitely worth raving about.  I didn't know what to expect, I was thinking these would be like those Momofuku/Ippudo-esque pork buns of wonder, these were NOT those, but of no less deserving of praise.  They were like actual cinnammon buns with icing and everything, but rolled up in the buttery sugary dough was shredded pork! Oh my...explosion in my mouth! So we then each ordered an entree, this seems like a normal next progression of the meal, but it was unusual for us, as ususally we just get a bunch of appetizers and share but we were so hungry that we screwed that thought and went for a full meal.  When I say that we each ordered an entree, I mean 3 of us ordered the chicken entree while the individualist got the trout.  I did not try her trout but apparently it was good.  Onto the chicken, now the only reason I picked the chicken was because it came with gnocchi and I am a sucker for those potato pillows of heaven, otherwise, I am never one to go with the chicken dish.  Let me tell you, this chicken was damn good! The skin was crispy and the meat was moist, which can be hard to find good, not dry chicken.  The jus was delicious and the mix of wintery vegetables were flavorful.  The gnocchi was absolutely perfect, taste, texture, everything oh my I could rave forever about how good that gnocci was, perfect pillows I tell you!  My only complaint was that I could have had 10x more gnocchi, but then I probably would have been stuffed fat American style so instead we all left full and happy.  Great food, great service, god help me if they take that gnocci off the menu.",9,9,9,9

I've come here twice for dinner, the first time I had Grilled Chicken and Artichokes and the chicken was sooo dry I practically choked on it. It was tasteless and bland too. The second time I ordered the Chicken Club and the chicken was again tasteless and dry. At least both dinners were warm though. Now you'd think I quit going, but I constantly walk past this place and it is packed! I thought, ""maybe I have to come here for the breakfast,"" Breakfast was worse, the Nutella French Toast was soggy and lukewarm ewwwww. The second time I went for breakfast I had already given up on this place, but my friend begged to go there and she too was disappointed. I ordered eggs and they were overcooked, my homefries were COLD and hard and tasted like cardboard. I tried to love this place, I really did! Please do better Penelope, live up to the reviews!

I wanted to try Market Table, as well, and the food and experience did not disappoint! I made a rez for one.  When I arrived, the hostess asked if I wanted a table or the bar.  I chose the bar.  The bartender was super nice.  As a few people came and sat at the bar, it seemed that he knew a few of them. Based on their chats, I deduced that they were regular patrons.  I had two of the mixed drinks and had the bartender choose what to give me.  Both were so good.  One of them had hot peppers and it was spicy!!!!  Woohooo!  Never had a spicy and delicious drink before. They brought out bread, olive oil, and sea salt.  The olive oil was nutty and delicious and, with the sea salt, made the bread taste earthy and pungent at the same time.   I ordered the pan roasted chicken for entree with a side of carrots.  The chicken was a half-chicken.  The first few bites did not seem that interesting or spectacular - just basic chicken.  But, as I continued to eat bite after bite, the flavors began to reveal themselves.  The chicken was juicy, tender, and succulent.  It had the right amount of faint saltiness and mild spice (maybe pepper), that I was able to taste a layering of flavors on the chicken.  The chicken was placed atop the spring pea risotto, which was creamy and delicious.  I wish they served a bit more of the risotto, but otherwise I can't complain.  The carrots were really good - spicy. The bartender asked me if I wanted to order dessert - and I said yes, because it's my birthday today.  A few minutes later my dessert arrives with a candle on top and the bartender and server saying happy birthday.  He then got me and the couple next to me some shots to celebrate.

Then the server sniffed at me and said that most people say the name of the item with irritated voice. During the whole dining she didn't come and check on me.

Grouper Fricassee - the bartender suggested this while we were waiting for our table, and it was a great choice. The fish was perfectly cooked and the bacon added the right amount of salt to the dish. Spaghetti & meatballs - normally I wouldn't order something I could make at home, but the waitress recommended this one. It was delicious. I'm glad we split this because the portion was way too big for one person...unless you're training for a marathon. We finished with the potato doughnuts.

Popped in here for lunch after craving a burger and man, do they have a burger. 10oz of hand packed hamburger meat sandwiched between two thin buns. In actuality, the buns probably weren't that thin, but the enormity of the beef patty made them seem so. I had asked for Swiss cheese and a side of onion rings. Instead I got Swiss with saut√©ed onions and a side of regular fries. Not being in a fussy mood, I rolled with it and was pleasantly surprised. This isn't the best burger I've had, but definitely fit the bill for this particular craving. We also ordered some potato skins for the table. Rather than skins, it was basically 3 halves of a potato covered in cheese and real bacon (not bacon bits) with a side of cream cheese. Molly's itself is a pretty cool place. I'd walked past it a number of times before, but had never been inclined to step inside. You are greeted by a long bar with a few booths and quite a few tables in the back. The floor is covered in sawdust* and Celtic (I think) music is playing in the background. The bartender also provided a very friendly greeting in his Irish accent. The place is very softly lit.

1641,13798,43,4/25/10,"Cookshop has good food - for brunch.  I might change my review if I ever go back there for dinner.  It is randomly located, sorta at the edge of Manhattan in no man's land.  I don't really consider it Chelsea.  It's more like the ""western most part of the island you can be on without being in the water"" neighborhood.   I went there recently as part of a mid sized group.   There was a large variety of food on the table - everything from salmon and eggs to biscuits to pancakes to skillet eggs, to sausage, to beignets.  Everyone was pretty happy with their food.  The pancakes looked great - fluffy and dripped in syrup (which is odd, most places don't put it on for you) and covered with a bit of cinnamon butter (which was fantastic) and bananas. The fries were delicious and topped with something that made them ""spicy"" fries - whatever that was made them yummy! The eggs I had were sunny side up and cooked perfectly.  The biscuit I tried was the right combo of buttery, fluffy, and crunchy.  The semolina cinnamon raisin toast I had with my eggs was also delicious.   Deviled Eggs were also good.   The space is nice, and modern, and pretty well lighted. I imagine that sitting by the windows provides you with a wonderful people watching vantage point.  I did also like that the menu seemed to change pretty regularly - I think that's a cool way to do things.   The only negatives I'd say were the fact that it was located far out and that the food isn't really all that surprising or all that creative. It's good, but it's pretty typical brunch food.   If I could, I""d give it 3.5 stars.  It's between a 3 and a 4, but not quite a 4 and definitely not a 3.  I give it a 3 because of it's location and somewhat strange service - I had to order coffee twice before they brought it to me! Definitely good for groups, definitely good for brunch. Just not a place I'd necessarily trek out too.  If I wasn't already in Chelsea, I might not seek it out.  There are a lot of really great brunch places in NYC - and plenty more that are really accessible.",6,5,4,1
1642,7232,486,9/15/11,"When I first moved to NYC, I was mystified by the $1 dumpling spots in Chinatown.  Dumplings are one of my favorite foods ever, and the thought of getting 4 or 5 of them for a dollar absolutely blew my mind.   I assumed that with such a price tag, I'd just have to deal with terrible customer service, hardly any English speakers, watered down Sriracha, questionable meat, questionable sanitation, and gross-weird tasting burps afterwords. .....then along came Vanessa's Dumpling House.  And the game was changed. Vanessa's is spacious, clean, has tons of seating, and a counter you can stand at while you eat and look out the window at Elridge Street.  The staff is great, for the most part.  They speak English well, they are friendly, helpful, and polite.  The meat seems to be of way better quality than most other dumpling spots i've been to in the neighborhood.  The pork and chive fried dumplings are MY JAM.  The sesame pancakes are also wassup.  The Sriracha is watered down :( but their food doesn't give you those gross-weird tasting burps like other places! Overall, this is THE spot for dumplings and for cheap eats.   I want to close this review out with a quick cooking tip for those of you who like to buy the frozen dumplings to make at home.   -get a pan super hot -hit it with some oil (sesame if u have it!) -spread the frozen dumplings in the pan, don't overcrowd -sear each side of each dumpling to a crispy golden brown (be patient!) -toss a few tablespoons to half a cup of water (depending on amount of dumplings) into the pan, cover, and lower heat to medium-low -in about 5-10 minutes you will have an absolutely amazing batch of dumpling that are the same, if not better than when you order them hot at Vanessa's.   Enjoy Dumpling fans!!!",8,7,7,5

Village and decided to try it. Actually, she made reservations but we still ended up waiting for 40 minutes. It was a packed house with barely enough room to sit, put your purse down, and scooch over for someone to walk by or sit next to you. The waiter was a well mannered young Korean guy and explained what the foods were on the menu and suggested what we should order based on what we like. Among the many things we ordered (can't remember em all) the pork buns and some deep fried brussels sprouts stood out the most. Based on the smiles, laughter, and widening of the eyes after the first bite of something from the other patrons, signaled to me that this place is basically... the bomb.

1657,121840,621,1/12/14,"On a cold, snowy night a few weeks before Christmas, we stumbled into Tony's, weary of the wait and expecting it to be a tourist over-priced sub par restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised. The wait was 45 minutes.. But after spending hours getting pelted with ice, it was a nice environment to be in. It is a family- style restaurant and everything was delicious. On an extremely crowded evening, the only down side is it's loud and you're sitting elbow to elbow with other tables.. but it seems to go along with the italian family style of the restaurant. I can't recall the exact dish we ordered but it is a great place for groups, families, birthdays, etc.. wonderful environment & very fun. It was just two of us so we decided on a meal, everything else was a la carte. The dish was something like chicken in a tomato bisque with shrimp.. delicious. I was surprised how affordable it was. The pitcher of sangria was also great along with the dessert. We were even more pleased with seeing the bill which was very reasonable. They haven't taken advantage of their location right off Times Square, an area obviously bustling with tourists.. even chain restaurants like TGI Friday's & Red Lobster practically double their prices due to their location. I would highly suggest to anyone looking for a pleasant experience in NYC. It even seemed as though there were plenty of locals and repeated, recognized customers which also goes to say how consistently appeasing this place must be. (I do have to mention I did not feel well after dinner but I think it was a combination of our meal and it was so good I'm hoping that's all it was.. hopefully no one else had the same experience! I will see next time as we are sure to visit again.)",7,7,8,5

She looked at Yelp reviews and was sold - hope this one helps out another would-be-goer. It's kind of funny because the wine list is larger than the menu, but that's part of the charm .. right? Plus, I don't need an extensive menu when EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. My friend and I split a bottle of red and she had the rissoto, I had the pork ribs. Guys, the food was so effing good I don't even know how to explain it. Also, halfway through the meal a duo of a trumpet and an accordian began to play and we kinda died out of joy.

It's a take out only restaurant so without looking at the menu i just asked for my favorite dish which is Pad Khee Mao with mixed seafood. When I opened up the bag I was blown away by the dish it's was chock full of seafood and for the first time i had mussels included as well. Once i tasted it i was impressed as well. It was, as i say, Thai spicy which was fine for me. it was so great that I had to call the take out place and pay my compliments to the chef.

1663,56088,238,7/24/14,"Amazing arrangements of ordinary and extraordinary ingredients into delightful plates! To quote my collegiate dining companion: stupid good. I can only think of one tiny suggestion for improvement at Grindhaus: serve the bread with the food instead of as the first course. That foie gras berry sauce in the big bowl simply cried out to be mopped up!! Starter (amuse bouche) was a tiny wine glass with diced peach and tomato in a slightly salty foam. Yum! Three craft beers on tap that summer evening: a very light summer ale, a slightly more robust summer ale (Blue point), and a nice non-summer ale. No flights but they'll let you sample all three, sweet. Servers must not be beer people, they struggled to explain the choices Sourdough bread for $6 was about 5 small slices with a generous dish of olive oil. Oh yeah it's just fine but for me it would have been better accompanying the food instead of preceding it. A salad ""purslane"" had dots of fluffy carrot pur√©e, crunchy quinoa, little tomatoes, slices of beets, dots of a smooth creamy cheese (ricotta maybe?) and other delicate goodies I just couldn't quite identify. Wow, $11 wasn't too bad. That fois gras might well have been our best dish, little lobes nicely warmed and served in a rich sauce of blueberries, balsamic, black pepper and other great stuff, about $20, spendy. An entree of blackened sea bass was heavily crusted on one side & perfectly cooked, served atop a fresh corn chowder described as polenta, with little globes that our server finally had to explain were special tiny eggplants. Excellent but (as other yelpers have noted) quite small, more tapas size than dinner, about $25. Vegetarian rating: 2ish stars, choices are salad and bread. The menu is so, so tiny, and they have not chosen to put on a proper warm veg entree. Warm & friendly service, happy to explain what we were eating. The 20 seats are folding chairs, ok but you won't settle in too deep lol. Worth the longish walk from the 9th Street subway stop west into Red Hook, but definitely bring plenty of money.",7,7,8,8

I went for brunch this past Saturday, and I guess I should have read my yelp reviews before I went, but only 6-7 brunch-type options are available on Saturdays... boo. I was really looking forward to digging into a great brunch menu.  Oh well. I ended up ordering the creme brulee french toast.  I thought it was delicious. It wasn't as unbelievable as everyone has been saying, but it was pretty good. It was mushier than most french toast because it does have some creme-brulee-type filling in the middle. Served with powdered sugar and maple syrup.  Good but not over the top.  My mom ordered the sesame salmon soba noodle salad - it was warm sesame coated salmon over a cold soba noodle salad in a ginger/soy type dressing. It was pretty tasty!!! Had a nice kick to it.  Our friend ordered the special of the day - smoked salmon benedict.  She pretty much fell in love right there at the table.  She said it was unbelievable (most other yelpers are agreeing about Jane's benedicts).   The decor was great... I felt super comfortable at Jane and the brunch crowd was an interesting mix of people. I noticed they also have a nice-sized party room downstairs for private parties. My server wasn't particularly great. He had zero personality, but was extremely attentive and ""with it.""   Overall, I wasn't nearly as impressed as I'd hoped I'd be.

So glad I found this hole in the wall - don't let looks deceive you - this place has the best oxtail I've had hands down. Something in the sauce or the oxtail they use - I dunno but the flavors are amazing and so good. I've tried oxtails and other dishes at Tina's cuban up by midtown east and also various Sophie's cuban locations - Margon wins in every way. The only thing I would say is missing is the green sauce but the food is so good here you won't need it. It gets packed during lunch  - just make your way to the back and order from one of the staff behind the counter. The chicken fricassee and oxtail are amazing. The staff is very nice as well and recognize you once you become a regular. They're very generous with the portions and will sometimes throw in a few extra plantains for you. There's surprisingly a decent amount of seats available for such a small space - they definitely use every sq inch possible. Prices are very decent for the quality and amount of food you get. Specials range from $9 for chicken entrees to $10 for oxtail/fish/pork and $11+ for shrimp ceviche - grilled salmon. The food is amazing here - I can't wait to try everything on the menu.

I had the Snowball (goldschlagger cinnamon schnapps, kaluha, coffee and whipped cream), and in house tiramisu upon the suggestion of the waitress.

1679,31613,247,6/2/14,"Went here for dinner and had a decent bowl of ramen here. The broth was a bit thin and bland, and the noodles were on the softer side which leads me to believe they may not be made fresh daily, or it was a culinary choice to overcook them like that. This is my first ramen place in NYC so I have no base of reference, I can only compare this to Toronto's ramen seen which is really quite developed. Now before you NYC'rs start hating on me, I've stayed in NYC long enough over several years to know that it's just silly to try to even suggest another city has better food than NYC. And for the most part, I'd agree, you're right... except in this one exception. For whatever weird cosmic alignment of the universe, Toronto has a really decent scene for authentic ramen. So I'd like to think I'd know a great bowl of ramen when I saw one. And Ippudo, well it was just good and not great. I've had better for less so I'm sad to say I can't give it 4 stars. My homeboy from Austin who ate with me and also knows a thing or two about ramen agreed: good, just not stellar. NB. For those of you who think the hostess is cherry-picking who she gives tables to. They use SMS to notify you when your table is coming up so you don't have to physically wait there.

The quest for the best grape leafin the city continues!  Came here for my birthday dinner. Kefi was outstanding.  To start we ordered the meatballs and the fried calamari.  Both were excellent. I really enjoyed the meatballs and the leftover sauce for dipping.  Calamari was pretty standard, but tasted great. I had the roasted chicken as my entree.  It was AMAZING.  Cooked perfectly.  Succulent, crispy, moist, bomb.  Served with small potatoes that were equally as good.  Others around me had ravioli.  I didn't know ravioli could be made into a Greek dish, but was very happy I tried it.   A birthday walnut cake with some walnut ice cream was brought out which were compliments of the house.  A nice gesture. The food at Kefi was as you probably gathered, delicious.  I will definitely come here again but I'd like to try another place first.   Kefi is a giant restaurant with millions and millions of tables. It has a downstairs floor that is nearly as big as the top floor.  We were jammed in a corner near a loud air conditioning unit with nearly no light.  I'm pretty sure we got that table because we were 10 minutes late for our reservation? Not sure.  We called ahead though.  Atmosphere is a big thing for me and I was so so on it for Kefi due to its size.   Kefi was a great choice for my birthday.   I would have given five stars if they served grape leaves and if the restaurant didn't look like Ellis Island  registration/booking hall circa 1880's.  (not a joke on immigration, but a slight on Kefi's PACKED vibe)",7,8,8,9
1682,69057,312,4/8/12,"Buttermilk Channel. I didn't realize that it was named after an actual body of water. I thought it was named after the buttermilk fried chicken. Which wouldn't be that bad. I heard about the restaurant in my search for chicken and waffles. The waffles didn't disappoint. The chicken...surprisingly did. Which is why the restaurant gets 4 stars. While the buttermilk crust has a delicious crunch and the chicken was juicy (borderline undercooked but just right), I guess I was expecting a little more flavor in the actual chicken itself. It is a wonderful restaurant. It seats about 50 I would say, so it's not the largest space, but the environment and ambiance is cozy and comfortable - AKA - perfect date spot. They don't do reservations for less than 6 so watch your timing - this place fills up quickly and the wait can be kind of long (mines was about 30-45 minutes). The service was great and for you beer and wine connoisseurs, there's a great selection (not fond of it myself). The cheddar waffles are delicious. Not too cheesy, but a good hint of cheddar and sweetness in the dough. The syrup was a nice flavor with a fruity reduction taste. The 'bread service' honey with salt popovers would be so much better if they weren't as brown and crispy as they were. Also, the dessert? Marvelous. I had the chocolate bread pudding with salted butterscotch and side of their ice cream - yummo. The prices are a bit high ($15-20+ for an entree), but the environment, ambiance, and service are worth it. As Arnold says... I'll be back.",7,6,8,7

Our group was seated shortly after 8pm on a Thursday, and we were thrilled when we found out that we would be dining in the covered backyard. The atrium is gorgeous! We ordered family style and shared the halumi, mixed platter, chicken tagine, mixed grill, duck confit, and special of the night (whole fish). The food was fresh and tasty, but admittedly nothing special. Portion sizes were fine, a little on the small side for hungry or big eaters. That being said, the diligent waitstaff and amazing ambiance make this a place worth checking out a second time. It's a great spot for a date or to catch up with a few friends.",7,6,8,8

I ordered the Vanilla Bean French Toast (brioche bread, cr√®me br√ªl√®e batter, Vermont maple syrup) with some strawberries on the side and my husband ordered Benedict Johnny (chicken sausage, cornbread, roasted tomato hollandaise) which came with roasted potatoes.  Our meal was delicious! The benedict johnny was a great mix of savory and sweet (the hollandaise leaned towards the sweeter side) but that played off greatly with the sausage and eggs. The french toast was delicious without being cloyingly sweet. Overall the experience was great! The wait staff was attentive and wonderful (water and coffee refills constantly).

I also enjoy just going for the mussels and fries. Nice selection of wines, beers and cocktails... the wine list includes a few organic selections.   It's also just nice to go to an establishment and every single time you're there be greeted by the owner... the ingredients are said to come mostly from local vendors.

If you want more coffee, you will probably have to flag someone down. I highly recommend the croissant sandwiches and home fries, and I love that the brunch dishes come with a green salad.

I have passed by Junior's several times and since it was empty at 9:30 this morning I thought that it was a perfect time to stop in. I ordered 2 eggs, bacon, home fries and a bagel. The eggs and home fries were great. The bacon was a little too chewy. Not under cooked but more like it was cooked with steam (seems odd but that is the only way to describe it). The bagel was OK, it was not as good as a local place. I expected more of a NY style bagel and it was more of a grocery store bite. I also ordered a slice of cheese cake and a black and white cookie to go. I have not had them yet but I will update my review after. The service was nice and fast.

1692,83143,412,4/4/13,"After being encouraged by my brother to check out the ""best macaroons in NYC"" (newyork.seriouseats.com/‚Ä¶) so he could live vicariously through me, it was hard for me to pass up the opportunity. I arrived early afternoon on a Friday and the line was already snaking around inside. After waiting 10 minutes or so, it had already built up outside the door! Despite the illogical set up of the store (the intensity of the line and the location of the cash register to the door), the experience ran rather smoothly. I found the customer service friendly, helpful and genuine. I immediately chose two flavors, chocolate and pistachio, but for the third was tossing up between coffee and salted caramel. I eventually settled on coffee (as recommended by the lady behind the counter). The chocolate was decedent and delicious without being sickening or over-the-top. I was most excited about trying the pistachio but unfortunately it was a bit of a let down. The nutty texture was spot on and exactly what you would expect from the perfect pistachio macaroon. Personally, however, the flavor was a little off. I have a self-confessed love affair with pistachio nuts (I eat them by the handful), but for me this tasted more of almonds, in particular Armareto, a flavor I don't really like. The coffee had a good flavor but I was hoping it would be a little stronger. The texture of these macaroons is exactly as they should be: a touch crisp, a little chewy and a good filling-to-outer ratio. The gift boxes are pretty and a nice touch if buying for a girlfriend/friend/lover/dinner date, however, unnecessarily expensive if you are going to eat them as soon as you step out of the shop (how could you not?), in which case the free paper bag will do! So if you don't mind a little (or a lot) wait, then Maison Ladur√©e will not disappoint. Enjoy!",8,5,7,7

1694,88714,445,6/20/12,"Honestly good Chinese food in NYC is scarce.  Great Chinese food, in Chelsea? Eh hem.  You must be imagining things from all the burritos you've been having at the Chelsea Chipotle. Before I get too ahead of myself, I will throw out this CAVEAT: I've only been once (but everything was cooked perfectly and I will be returning soon). Me and my girlfriend ordered: 1. Fried Rice with Chinese sausages and a fried egg: (Dude) This dish was prepared and executed very well.  There was a nice unexpected kick which added/heightened to the dish.  Typically I'd expect most restaurants to serve and throw this dish together on the fly with little attention to technique but the results proved opposite.  The fried egg - cooked perfectly. Not one mark of browning/over burnt but the egg still contained the fried crunchy texture with light fluff consistency! (For anyone who has ever cooked an fried egg, this was very impressive). The fried rice itself was not too greasy which is amazing to get at a Chinese restaurant and contained fresh peas! 2. Short Ribs served over a bed veggies with white rice : (YES Sir) Being the critical and picky person I am about my Chinese food (being Chinese and growing up as a child having every meal be Chinese until I 13 b/c my father refuses to eat anything else), I will admit I thought the fried rice was a fluke and had my doubts about the next dish but I must admit I was proved wrong.   *The Short Ribs were delicious.   First the quality of the short rib really came through the dish.  It appeared to be braised because of the texture and constancy of the way the short rib melted away (fell off the bone).  The flavors were very similar to short rib or brisket that you'd find in some of the best Taiwanese beef noodle soup dishes.   I was not disappointed at all.  In fact the only thing I was disappointed about is that they didn't have a Taiwanese beef noodle soup item on the menu.  If the owners/chef are reading this, you guys are 80% there with the flavors and the short rib....please put a Taiwanese beef noodle dish on the menu or at least create a secret one so I can order it!   3. Chinese spring veggies.  (Wow really?!?!) To avoid beginning to sound redundant I'll make this one short and simple. *Fresh. Clean. Delicate. Perfectly cooked.   Seriously though, there is no reason why veggies can't taste as satisfying as this every time.   I credit the technique. 4. Veggie Dumplings: (I dig it) When you have good food, you just want to keep eating, so me and my gf went for it.  Already feeling stuffed we ordered something (Veggie Dumplings) that allowed us to keep going hoping not to regret later (we're trying to leave our gluttonous food coma days behind us).     **The dumplings were tasty.   When it comes to dumplings, preferences boil down to the individual.   The texture of the skin was perfectly deep fried to give you that crunch and my GF pointed out and appreciated the fact they didn't chop down the veggies to a point where they were so minced the taste, freshness and quality of the veggies couldn't come through. Last my only regret is that some items were a few dollars over what I'd like to spend.  If it was just $2-$4 dollars cheaper here and there, there is not doubt in my mind this place would be the type of restaurant you'd wait 40mins plus for.  Eh I guess its give or take. All and all, great job guys.  I hope it wasn't a fluke or the luck of the draw, but my tasted buds, and belly wants to say ""our first meal at Chop Shop was 108% satisfying!""

Basically to get one slice of bacon on your lobster roll it costs you $2, which I don't think is worth it. The only other gripe is that you get so much lobster on the roll that it is tough to eat - this isn't really a gripe, it's amazing.

It tends to get a bit crowded and there's almost always a wait on the weekend. We got there at about 11:30 and there was a 20 minute wait for tables. By the time we left there was a small crowd outside waiting to be seated. We had raw oysters and pulled pork sandwiches. I was probably a little too trusting to go with the oysters but they were great. Sanford's had wallpapered the front entrance with rave reviews of their pulled pork sandwiches, and they really work good. Smoky flavor, great sauce. It was $14 for the sandwich (no fries or chips, the waitress warned me), two bloody maries (the lady had mimosas), and a couple cups of coffee. Oysters were like $8 or so. For a classy breakfast out it was worth it. Service was good. The waitress checked in a few times and always seemed to be nearby if we needed anything.

Decor is Brooklyn industrial chic with rustic Italian accents thrown in (not very cohesive, but who cares?). Its nice enough for a casual and quick date, with plenty of options to nibble on. They make lovely sangria and have a pretty good drink selection. Menu leans Asian and Spanish, which sounds bizarre, and I believe the owners are Thai based on overhearing the kitchen conversation.

My table of five ordered: -  Shrimp dumplings in chili oil (Special) -  Grilled octopus with canelli beans and eel basil sauce (Special) -  Chicken liver crostini (Special) -  Cinnamon pumpkin soup (Special) -  Coconut mussels -  Truffle fries The food was solid, relying on sauces to carry the complexity of the dish. The shrimp dumplings were nice and hot. The liver was tasty, without being whipped too smooth or heavy with cream. The soup was surprisingly light even though it came with whipped cream! And the truffle fries with cheese and bacon are pretty impossible to mess up - they were great. The only dish I was meh about was the octopus. The octopus legs were thin and overcooked, to the point where the thinner parts were DRY. The eel sauce was laid on pretty heavily. I love octopus, but this dish was pretty meh. The food came out in waves, allowing us to eat and complete a dish without being overwhelmed. Staff was helpful, quite knowledgeable, quirky, and charming. Since we went on a Monday night, it was super easy to get a table, water refills, and flag down someone to order more food. The staff actually played a trick on us, telling us the truffle fries were sold out, but brought them to our table a few minutes later to surprise us, which was kinda cute. They didn't rush us to finish eating or pay, which was great because my friends were trying to kill some time. The major con: Signage is AWFUL - in the dark I walked by it three times, wondering if I was reading my map wrong. The building doesn't have a number displayed prominently and the ramen place next door is more eye-catching. The menu is displayed, but the name isn't easily seen.

At the end the family style portion was not enough to go around for everyone. Out of my party of 12, 4 didnt eat I was so embarrassed !!! I will never go here ever again, I cannot believe the embarrassment I had to go through. I made a Yelp account just to write this review... that should tell you something.",1,9,1,9

1726,98630,484,5/31/13,"Meh. Nothing crazy or special about this place. Their BBQ sauce taste like ketchup. Their other BBQ sauce tasted like chipotle. I had the brisket and pork belly and a few sides. The brisket didn't have the classic salty-ness I've come to expect and enjoy from most briskets. It actually tasted pretty bland and I felt like it was missing something. It hardly had any smoke flavor in it. The pork belly was not bad but again very little in the way of smoke flavoring. Maybe their idea of low and slow is a 2 or 3 hour smoke job. It is New York and everyone is in a rush. BTW what gives with not having pork ribs? I thought that was a BBQ standard? Anyway moving on. Oh no beef ribs either on my visit but back to my review. I think the raving reviews are probably more from the hippies enjoying themselves at the communal tables than the actual quality of the food or the atmosphere. After a while groups were just sitting at the tables talking although they had been done eating for over 20 minutes and there were people waiting to find a place to sit. Oblivious to the world around as most hipsters and hippies are they just sat there and continued to talk and bullshit while people waited with trays of food on their hands and having to eat standing up. I'm not big into the communal sitting thing either I don't understand the hype. I'd rather eat a place like Blue Smoke or Dinosaur BBQ any day over that mad house with mediocre food. Also, about the potato salad, I'm not sure what they were going for but I've never had anything like that. Again I wasn't impressed, think potatoes not fully cooked with light coating mayo some garden herbs and a sprinkle of mustard seed. Except when I say sprinkle I meant some jokester must have twisted the cap because that shit was covered in it! The broccoli uses the same exact seasoning as the potato salad. Both were cold which was expected of the potato salad but not the broccoli. The beans were really good and are the one thing I have no complaints about and can actually recommend with clear conscious. Anyone thinking of traveling from any where other than the immediate neighborhood just to try this because its been rated ""the best BBQ in New York City"" I recommend you pass unless you're a masochist that enjoys disappointment and overpaying.",4,3,3,4
1727,125917,650,5/19/13,"Dined at Park Ave Tavern with my husband, father, and his girlfriend and the overall experience was truly subpar. When we first arrived, my father requested a table rather than booth (he has a bad knee) and we were told we could not sit at any of the available tables because they were reserved for parties of six or more. Understandable but frustrating as they remained unoccupied during our meal. My father's girlfriend found a piece of hard plastic in her tomato soup. It was reddish in color and had clearly been steeping in the soup for hours. We brought this to the attention of our waiter.  He did not take away the soup but brought over a small plate so he could carry the plastic to the kitchen.  From my seat, I could see into the kitchen as the chefs studied the small plastic chunk. As we continued, she found two more pieces of plastic and sent the soup back. We were very understanding as the waiter apologized an offered to bring another bowl but she was not interested in eating more of the plastic-laden soup. The manager came over to apologize and offered to buy us a drink, dessert or even a round of drinks. We explained that neither my father nor his girlfriend drink and he asked us to let him know what they could do.   We completed our middling/overpriced meal. When we were ready to leave, we asked that the three soups we ordered not be charged.  The waiter returned with the bill and did not mention that they had not honored our request. When we brought this to his attention, he said his manager refused to take the soups off the bill (only the plastic-y soup was removed). The price of the soups was surely less than a round of drinks (my husband had $13 cocktail and I had a similarly priced glass of wine).  We were really disappointed in the experience and would not recommend this restaurant.",1,6,2,8

1730,20198,247,5/11/10,"Absolute truth, I've been to Ippudo more than a handful of times and it took the last visit, maybe my 6th+ time to finally remember what the ramen tasted like, but I decided to try the duck ramen which I've never had before and I was utterly disappointed.  Bland broth, chewy overcooked duck.  I was so sad because everyone seems to love this place. So, in my mind, the ramen here is totally unmemorable.  I did try my friend's ramen which was the most popular one, the Akamaru  recommended by the server and it was good but not amazing.  The broth was good, there's a lot going on there but I've definitely had better.  Ippudo is definitely overhyped I think mainly due to the 1+ hour wait.  An hour or more for ramen?  No thank you, I was expecting unique/different/mindblowing but was very underwhelmed. The appetizers are great though.  The fried chicken, cucumber salad, pork buns and tartare are yums but the ramen lacks that made-with-love-and-care broth that I really savor. There are a few other things about the place that I don't love, long wait aside, eating in front of mirrors is not my thing and the yelling when you walk into the dining area doesn't do it for me.  Also when I first started going to Ippudo when it first opened, almost everyone who worked there was Japanese.  Now you're lucky to have a Japanese dude cooking your noodles....

1734,135785,723,3/6/11,"On the rainiest Sunday night of the year we wandered in to the cold welcome of a ma√Ætre d' who seemed delighted to greet a somewhat soaked, apologetically reservationless young couple with news that their seating options were limited because he expected torrents of diners.  Diners who would never pour in.  We were shown upstairs, through the kitchen, to a table ""overlooking the street,"" which felt far colder and slightly less attended than a locker for meat. So we opted to dine at the bar tended by Christian.  With his Pacific countenance and combative nature, Christian somehow managed to make the bar feel far icier than the meat-locker upstairs.  He claimed not to have a favorite cocktail.  Candid perhaps, but awkwardly inappropriate nonetheless.  When queried for suggestions and recommendations, he responded with ""facts"" about the menu.  ""People like the short ribs; that's just a fact.""  They were fine.  But on the whole the food was unoriginal and uninspired.  And after every round of food or drink, Christian would update our tab and place it in a shot glass in front of our drinks.  He claimed that the ten-month-old practice was necessary in order for the runners to find us at the bar and seemed puzzled at how that such an innovative practice might make diners feel rushed and unwelcome.     The staff was surly, which we surely believed to result from maltreatment by management.  A portly, bespectacled Philip Seymour Hoffman qua Mickey Rourke sort arrived behind the bar midway through our meal, pounded pinkish Bloody Marys and spoke of some impending ""first class"" trip to Vegas he had booked with miles.  We debated whether he was an oppressive higher up or an oppressed subordinate as his all-black garb obscured any markings of managerial or proprietary standing.  Bless his big soul if that Vegas trip was but a temporary escape from a really bad sitch.... We ended up tipping Christian 20% -- not for his service but to provide a modicum of compensation for his apparent servility.  In response, Christian nary turned his cheek to say goodbye....

I'm no longer unemployed, but let's just say, this was a safe haven for me where people passed no judgment except for the impatient Chinese ladies taking my order. For those who don't mind eating out of plastic containers and sharing bottles of soy sauce and Sriracha hot sauce with the stranger next to you, this place will satisfy your pangs of hunger from eating PB&J sandwiches for a week straight. For less than $5, I enjoyed a full meal consisting of a Roast Pork Sesame Pancake, a #1 (four fried Pork & Chive dumplings) and a Diet Coke. After several visits, my friends and I can attest that the roast pork sandwich is way tastier than the roast duck. My one gripe about the place is that the customers who dine here are straight up mean. Lighten up, y'all. It's first come, first serve. Secure your own table.

1737,3264,668,4/15/11,"Best to describe this place as the Disney World of Italian markets. Just an amazing mess of a place and obvious money grab aimed at the tourist market and uppity monied New Yorkers who feel the trendy thing to do is pay for overpriced food goods. As I work pretty close to this place I had a chance to walk through it recently for the first time. What I encountered is a scattered cataclysm of aisles filled with all types of Italian foods, pastas, sauces, candies, oils, meats, seafood, cooking goods, etc. Even more confusing is the multiple restaurant set up, as there seems to be a central area in the middle where most are located, and them more on the outer reaches of the floor. In the dead center is a standing room service area where you can eat on these high top marble tables, but there is lack of staff waiting on these and overall confusion reigns. Overall prices in this place are out of control. As if that fat as a house chef Mario Batali was not wealthy enough he has to subject us to this blatant cost inflated menagerie. Does he, and the group that own this place, think that all New Yorkers are rich, or just plain stupid? I have to admit when I dropped that morning I had a really good cappuccino and a nice buttery croissant. Small seating area up front by main opening was pleasant enough to sit at and enjoy my snack. I wanted to give it a shot for lunch and I ordered the lunch meal of the day which was Prime Rib Panino with chopped salad. For $14 it actually was a decent sized sandwich on a crispy hard roll. Salad had a tasty light dressing to it. Had a GUS soda to wash it down with. For about $20 with tax it does come out to be an expensive lunch option. That is the problem here. Everything adds up, and you end up paying more then you normally would for a meal. I also had to flag down a waiter to take my order and service was slow overall. If you do consider yourself a gourmet food type person, and like to cook, then this type of place will suit your needs. It is packed to the gills with pastas, meats, groceries, cooking tools, wines, desserts, etc. Just be prepared to melt your credit card, or take out a wad of cash at the ATM that is strategically placed up front when you walk in!",7,7,6,5

I entered the store right as they opened and ordered a classic mild spicy and a thai iced tea. They called my number in less than 5 minutes. So fast! I love that. I ripped open the bag and tore the sandwich in half. First mistake - everything was crumbly. The ground pork spilled all over and the daikon radish and carrots fell out of the sandwich leaving me to place the carrots and radish back on top of the sandwich during each bite. The sandwich itself? Pretty standard. The toasted French baguette is pretty good and so is the thai iced tea. For $6.75 a sandwich, I would recommend hanco's simply because where else are you going to get bahn mi in park slope and a really chill location to go to for a date or just for lunch?",7,6,8,5

Inside is nice - brick walls and rustic country tables.   There is room to dine al fresco, which we did.   Service is decent, and the wine list will offer enough to satisfy you regardless of your food choices.  Now the food which I can only give 3 stars - maybe 3.5.   We stopped because of all the truffle possibilities, and I ordered the Polenta Tartufata without thinking.  If I had stopped there, I think everything would have been fine.  The polenta was decent, and the sauce had plenty of truffle flavor but there was so much oil and cream in the sauce, my appetite was pretty much shot by the time the appetizer was finished. Instead of stopping there I went to the gnocchi (also prepared with a cream/truffle sauce), and I may as well have eaten a 1/4 lb. of butter.  By the time this entr√©e was half eaten the sauce had separated into pools of fat.  It was all the extra fat that took two full stars away from my rating; too much fat says a lot about a chef not being able to balance a sauce correctly. My wife had a good salad, and an entr√©e with pasta, basil and fresh tomatoes that I would recommend, and probably order (if I ever return).

Then I had the chicken pot pie and it came out pretty quickly - before I had quite finished my soup. The crust is awesome and the pie was well-balanced and very good. The market greens were great, too. The dressing is light and there's just enough to give you flavor without drowning the greens. Perfect balance to the heavier pot pie. All in all, I enjoyed it.

First the good: ..appetizers- the Cypriot salad was a refreshing, very enjoyable light summer salad,  the grilled octopus is good- not chewy, perfect char, with a touch of lemon. Service was efficient and pleasant. Ok so what is not to like? The main dishes we ordered were clumsily presented, over stuffed with chips, and a soggy salad like you would get at a college food truck. The entrees- chicken souvlaki and the lamb burger were just ok. Our biggest dislike was the way the restaurant looked and was laid out. Tables jammed together, hard services, little in the way of decor that reminds you that you are eating at a Greek Restaurant, in other words it has ZERO Greek charm, soul or ambiance. To make matters worse, we were sent to the Kefi basement to eat (even though there were plenty of open tables upstairs). And no surprise here, the Kefi basement smells like ....a musty basement. Also, when sitting downstairs, expect to be in very close proximity with other people (who were banished to the musty basement), and expect to watch the kitchen staff move dirty dishes back and forth while you eat.

We went there with a couple of friends for a Saturday brunch. It was a lively place with a beautiful crowd. But I expected better food. I thought my salmon omlette was too small and a bit overcooked. The toast was too dry and hard.  Though I must say I did enjoy the grits and the scones they gave at the beginning. For a bill that worked out to be $30/person, I thought they could have at least added some fresh fruits on the side. It was definitely not worth standing in line for half an hour and the price. Having lived in Montreal for a few months before, I can name many similar brunch places but with a more inspiring menu, better-cooked food, larger portions and at much lower price.",2,4,1,7

1766,134030,820,2/22/12,"I came here for dinner on a Thursday night, and the weather was beautiful.   The menu is pretty small and overpriced but so are a lot of things in New York.  Anything other than a burger, and you're probably looking at almost $20 for an entree. You order food/drinks at the window, and your food is ready when your number shows up on the screen.  It would be nice if they brought out your food, because navigating between all the tables set close together can get annoying and feels almost maze-like.  I got the cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper pasta), and it was pretty good.  The pea to pasta ratio seemed off, though, with too many peas.  This could also be to my own deficiency with eating peas; they are impossible to eat because they just roll all over the place.  My friend got the grilled chicken caesar salad, and she seemed to like it.  I'd say save money on the food and splurge on the drinks because... The real reason to come here is for the sangria (red or white) and the atmosphere.  The sangria is nice and has good-sized chunks of fruit, and while sipping it you just feel relaxed.  We came a little before sunset, which was an awesome decision.  The sky was pink, orange and blue - just really beautiful.  If you want to get a better view, grab a bench on the pier to sit and enjoy.",7,6,8,7

1768,5323,648,1/6/15,"Can't say I'm a fan, thus, no 4 stars. Round this up to a 3.5 if you're really a stickler for star ratings on Yelp. I came here last Friday along with what appears to be several other diners who also read the feature on Balvanera in the ""Tables for Two"" column in the New Yorker. This Argentinian (Argentine and Argentinian are also supposedly valid words...I had no idea that these were real words) restaurant is located in LES, featured prominently on the corner of Stanton and Suffolk st. I don't even think I can say that I've been to more than five Argentinian restaurants in my life, so I was happy to try out this new place after reading the raving review. The food wasn't a complete miss, but it certainly underwhelmed. Let's start with what my gf and I shared: Sardines Sweetbreads Octopus Bone-in Ribeye Sardines were solid. Sure, it could've been better. But for your everyday serve-in-a-restaurant sardines, these were savory with a pinch of citrus at the end. Paired quite well with the bread provided. The sweetbreads dish was perhaps the highlight of the night. It was a bit...chewier than I liked, but it wrapped up with a nice crispy note at the end and the other ingredients accompanying the sweetbreads were laid out perfectly. Well done on the presentation. The octopus is where this meal began to slacken. The two biggest mistakes you can make while cooking octopus are related to cooking time and cleaning time. Cook it for too little or too long and you've got tough octopus. This is what we had on that particular night. The octopus came out seasoned well enough, but was very difficult to chew. As I'd said, it's paradoxically difficult and easy to mess up octopus cooking. It's a very simple ingredient to work with, but you really have to make sure that you time the cooking just right. In this case the octopus definitely fell flat. The Ribeye was equally unimpressive and I KNOW people won't shut up about South American beef, more specifically Argentinian and Brazilian beef. So I'm expecting some crazy good beef and it came out just meh. I imagine much of the hullabaloo stems from other countries not breeding out the fat in their animals like the US stupidly does, leaving all the juicy flavor instead of siphoning out fat. But I didn't really taste much of that extra flavor in this evening's meal. It was a better steak than usual...but comeon, did I really come to this restaurant for above average steak? I'm torn as to whether I should recommend this restaurant to friends...it's good, but not great, so if you're in the mood for trying out new cuisines and have yet to sample Argentinian fare, I'd give this a shot with your expectations tempered.",6,5,5,3
1769,21118,72,3/20/14,"Wow, if this ramen is considered 4 stars good in NYC, then ramen in Cali deserves 6/5 stars. I could not believe the 1.5 hr wait for this ramen. Crazy, someone needs to open up better ramen shops in NYC. I heard Ippudo isn't any better. My issues with the ramen: Broth - Chicken broth is for sure inferior to pork broth. So bland! Noodles- Thin and average nothing special at all. Onions - So much raw onions in the bowl!!! Ack!! Green ones on top and white onions filled the bottom. Eww not what I had expected. Miso - A cold clump of miso sits on your bowl that has an alcoholic taste to it yuck. It made my bowl colder and thicker so I took it out. Poached egg- Very cold, also made my bowl cold. Chicken - Don't get it unless you truly hate pork.  I chose it to taste something different but regretted it. I was starving when I ate this so there is just no excuse. Cannot compare with Ramen Dojo (San Mateo), Orenchi (Santa Clara), Daikokuya (Los Angeles) which all serve far superior ramen.",3,7,2,9

1771,74499,356,9/2/07,"Such a cozy, unobtrusive little bar tucked away on 5th street; you hardly might give it a second glance while walking by. The bartender is beyond great (or maybe I'm just incredibly partial to being called darling by someone with an irish brogue) and the decor transports you to a more rustic place - almost perhaps woodsy tavern in the middle of a cold winter, while large-bosomed bar-wenches offer you up another pint. (That last bit could just be me getting carried away, but then again, I do think they filmed some kind of movie of that sort here recently.) I love this place on a semi-quiet weekday night where there is enough clientele to give the place a warm murmur and bustle but not enough where you can't speak over the noise. It's just such a great no-frills place, mixed crowd, no pretension or seen/be-seen that I've observed. This is the place you go to when you just want to grab a drink with a friend and catch-up, or just hang out.  I've rarely frequented on a weekend night but from the few experiences I have had and the times I've walked by, it does get a lot crazier.",7,6,8,8

I was visiting some friends here in the NYC area, and a foodie friend of mine recommended Cookshop for lunch. It was a warm Saturday afternoon in mid April, and we arrived a bit early for our 2:30pm reservation hoping to grab a seat outside. This place was out of control and she wouldn't seat us early as there was a 40 minute wait for walk ins. We decided to come back at 2:30pm and walk the highline while we wait. We came back at 2:30pm and again requested outdoor seating. The hostess stated there were no outside tables available and we could wait for an unknown amount of time if I wanted for a patio table or I could be seated inside within 10 mins. We chose the inside option. Service was pretty good considering how busy this place was. The restaurant is quite large, and there were some notable celebs dining at Cookshop. My friend and I split the Merguez appetizer. It was legit! A nice long swirl of sausage served with creamy polenta. YUM For my entree I ordered the  blue- and Jonah-crab poached egg over toasted brioche. It was rich, messy, and tasty I highly recommend. Lunch ran about $100 for three, but it was well worth it considering it went on the Corporate Amex. I would definitely recommend checking out this place if you're in the Chelsea area.

Located right next to the Ave J train station, Q train. Part of the experience is WATCHING him make pizza - he's been doing it for 43 years. You can see his picture of his glory days hanging by the oven. 2)Everything is pure ORIGINAL - his sauce is homemade with tomatoes from his town in Italy. The SAUCE is WONDERFUL(people were murmuring ""the sauce, the sauce"" in ecstasy when they were eating)His extra virgin olive oil is marvelous! His cheese is beautiful, and he chunks it onto the pre-pizza. The flour is nice and crispy, it's perfect. The crust is such an experience because it ranges from soft to crispy to burnt. His ingredients are all FRESH and natural - the sausages were cut right in front of us. WOW SOME TIPS ABOUT EATING AT DI FARA PIZZERIA 1)Come when it opens or you will be waiting for a HOUR for your pizza -even SLICES can take up to 45 minutes. Just order a PIE. (Check the prices in the picture section) *****DON'T BOTHER TO CALL DURING BUSY TIMES - THEY WILL NOT PICK UP THE PHONE(I was personally there on a friday afternoon - they were so busy, the phones kept ringing but noone picked up the phone....so good luck) 2)It's a SMALL place. Be prepared to get cramped. The seating section is very small too. 3)If you are GERM A PHOBIC, stay away. He uses hands only, collects cash with the same hands too.

However, lately I've been finding myself more and more disappointed with their xiao long baos. (FYI- my favorite place for soup dumplings is Din Tai Fung in Taipei-- the BEST XLBs in the world!!) Unfortunately, the last time I went to Joe's, I found their XLBs to be only so-so, with the meat inside the dumplings to be slightly pink and very very oily. Maybe there's a new chef in the kitchen? Or my trip back to Taiwan awakened my tastebuds..I have no idea. Their other chinese dishes are good but also americanized for the local taste. Joe's Shanghai is ALWAYS busy on the weekends (being slightly better on the weekdays). I guess that's what you get for being one of the most popular restaurants in Chinatown!

I'm sure it won't matter as the weather gets cooler, but with these sweltering days lately, I can definitely see it being an important factor for diners. It's actually crazy hot there and I was patting down my forehead every few minutes. The wait staff was nice and smiled a lot but not particularly attentive or friendly. The place was packed at 9pm on a Sunday night so definitely make reservations. The food is above average (3.5) but relatively simple. Others strongly recommended the spinach gnocchi (solid 4) but because I don't really like the strong taste of gorgonzola, I didn't order it. However, I tasted a friend's and it was delicious! A good combo of creamy but light and buttery. I had their Arugula salad, which was pretty standard (3).  I also tried their special for the night, which was a seafood spaghetti (3.5) in a red sauce.

The place was smaller than expected and I assume smaller than they would like it to be because the place was PACKED. Every seat and space used allowing one to get friendly with their neighbor especially if you want to be noisy and look at what someone else is eating. Doing it sly is hard to buck up and ask what their eating cause I did and found out about the MAC ATTACK. Three medium servings of different styles that were gooey and intense in flavor. Personally favored the Buffalo Style and Smoked Gouda with Bacon. And not the bits type either. Priced perfect for sharing for 2 but be warned. This serving with the bread and a glass of one of their signature cocktails is enough for a meal which means my dinner went into a doggy bag and didn't even get chance to get to the dessert menu. Entree choice was the Butternut Squash Ravioli which consisted of 6 huge BS. raviolis with roasted butternut squash squares scattered around. Toasted pine nuts and sauteed sage in a Meyer Lemon butter sauce surrounded the yummy confection. Now, one may not think this is anything new, common ingredients but I enjoyed the addition of arugula, garlic slices, stuffing croutons, and large shavings of Parmesan cheese. The bites I had there were really good and hearty and having it for breakfast the next day tasted even better. Definitely going back. The waiter was very nice and did a great job considering the amount of tables he was handling. The missing star is for the fact that I think the restaurant knows how good it is and piles a lot of people in there plus, by serving if I must say, large portions, people can sit there and eat that much so they take the food to go making a normal 1-11/2 hour dinner sit down into 30-40 mins.

Dining in at this small and intimate restaurant typically involves some wait time depending on the time of day, with Brunch being by far the worst.

From what I understand, the blueberry pancake is the signature dish at the restaurant, and it was amazing! I have also tried the raspberry and chocolate and it certainly stood well on its own against the blueberry. But from a culinary perspective, the only difference between different pancakes is the topping, and the pancakes themselves are always the same... Now as for other dishes and sweets at Clinton Street, including other baked goods, I've tried enough to say that they are mediocre if you hold the place to the standard of its famed pancakes. There are a lot of other restaurants around Low East Side and Alphabet City that offer better quality of similar dishes for less money and less wait. Services are spotty.

Obviously, Greenwich village hillbillies don't know what a true falafel tastes like !  3 bucks for HALF a falafel sandwich ! That's more evil than paying 20 for a slice of pizza.   The falafel itself was cracked and way tooooo crispy.  I felt as if I was eating chips. Instead of Israeli salad , they put lettuce in their pita bread !  This place is tiny and there is no place for you to turn or move once inside.  I am giving it one star because the pita bread was warm and sort of crispy too.

Now that i live in the area i had to try it. As always for the BL franchise the decor is beautiful, simple and clean. The menu at this location (i guess owing to the modern american offerings) is over twice as extensive with must more modest offerings (like fried chicken and a KIDS Menu!!) but they have all of the BL favorites (amazing oysters/the best steak tartar, marrow/grilled sardines etc.)   Anyway i tried to stop my heart with the Beef Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade. Of course it was amazing - tasty, rich and almost disgustingly rich. I loved it. the toasted bread and flavorful/crunchy sea salt were great and the marmalade is enough to make your cardiologist scream ""whhhhhyyyyyy?"" but it's oh so good. My only gripe is that they changed the prep and instead of the three (2"") sections of bone cut into sections there were three (4"") sections of bone cut laterally...which amounted to DOUBLE the amount of marrow - i was Stuffed after the ap! For the main i had the Skate (""potatoes, bacon, shrimp"" what are you fn kidding me?"") which was amazing even if i had to take it home and sadly found that outside of the spell of the wonderful atmosphere (read: wine) it was a little salty....but seriously ""potatoes, bacon, shrimp"" (!!)",6,7,6,7

1821,53550,215,8/22/13,"Several things here are excellent, a few are atrocious. Lets start off with the positive. First, use your eyes, and don't sit under a speaker. You will find the seating is very comfortable and the music is just right. It is my understanding the bartenders are the DJs and they make a great mix. They have definitely done their homework on Spotify.  The lighting is soothing and the overall color scheme is cozy and warm. The staff is excellent. Cocktail waitresses are attentive and are up for genuine conversation, not just flirtatious banter. The bartenders are professional, experienced, well-versed, and most importantly, fast. Unfortunately, it's rare in Astoria to come across a bartender that knows how to make a drink properly, so I appreciate them when I see one. Now, the negatives mostly stem from the fact that the clientele is a few years younger. I am in my early 30's and understand I just may be too old for Astoria. What I do not understand is the mid-20's Astoria brand of hipster, nor the bro-tank kids. Their conversations always tend to be at a volume that must be overheard by surrounding patrons. I personally find that if I wanted to talk to them, I would pull up a chair. They shouldn't be a part of my tables' conversation from 8 feet away. I think the obnoxious young men are the genesis of the noise issue that was brought up on some other reviews, as opposed to the music. The other negative is there are a lot of dudes. Seriously, bring women if you want to talk to any because they are in short supply. Overall, go for a late nightcap with your friends Mon-Wed and you will have a great time.",5,6,5,4

I got their Set B Lunch, which was basically a full range of what they have to offer in terms of hot food. It was so good! The side dishes change everyday so it was a surprise as to what I would get. I was very happy with the day's selection - Mushrooms/shrimp in a cream sauce and saut√©ed greens. The dessert was DIVINE. We had their green tea souffle and GAH. There are no words to describe it.

I ordered the Lomo Saltado $24 and shared it with the bf since it was too pricey for an entree each. The portion was a good size and the meat tasty BUT the pieces of meat and vegetables were waaaay too big for a stir fry. You constantly had to cut it into smaller pieces to eat each chopped piece. The rice had butter in it which I would have preferred bland considering how strong the sauce is. The salchipapa was ok, bland really and could have used a sauce. It was just hot dog pieces and fries really. I used ketchup and the green salsa they give. Not sure about the chicken as my favorite peruvian dish is the lomo saltado. Service was not good, when my boyfriend wanted to change the inka kola for a cerveza the waiter said he couldnt because ""I already put it on the ticket"" The inka kola was not even opened yet! Is it really sooo difficult to change it on the ticket using a computer? I dont think so. Decor is not impressive. While the children and peruvian religious art on one wall is interesting the rest of the restaurant fell flat. Especially the grubby floor that felt like it was either very dirty or rubber.

There are mostly (it seems) communal tables so if you don't come with a large group you'll be sitting with a bunch of strangers. The cooks and waiters also greet you in Japanese upon entering the dining area. This got a bit annoying towards the end with more and more guests coming in. I know it's common in Japanese restaurants but they're quite loud and hearing it 10+ times as you try to enjoy your meal gets a bit annoying. I've been waiting to try their ramen for so long but always run into a long line so I was definitely looking forward to it. I ordered the Karaka Men. The soup was very flavorful and rich but I think the spices overpowered it a bit. The noodles were not as chewy as I would have liked and my pieces of pork were a bit dry.

Literally just felt like little buns of patty in front of us. It was cheap though--whole dinner came out to be less than $20 since we both weren't too hungry.

The portion of it was good while the pickes/vegetables were fine as well. 3 small pieces of meat in the goat curry is not nice however. Swam in oil but I guess it was good for dipping.

My neighborhood one (Brooklyn) may win for cleanliness and best smelling and nicest lady behind counter, but I can't find it on Yelp to review. Oh yea, stick with the pulled noodles. And the beef tastes better than the pork I had the last time. Also, please leave your vegetarian and non-red meat eating friends home. Oh and if you're done eating, you better get up to give your seat up to someone else. And, you can't have any qualms about sharing a table. Or being asked to leave once you're done.

Our waiter was extremely friendly and personable, but most importantly probably one of the most knowledgable waiters I've encountered. Appetizer: Cauliflower- a large chunk of roasted cauliflower in some delicious vinegar-like sauce. Interesting textures and flavors; Definitely worth trying. Short rib gnocchi- small portion but a very hearty dish. The creamy sauce was quite tasty, and although the short rib was a bit dry, when dipped in the sauce it was still quite delicious. Entree: Scallops and Duck Breast- the scallops were perfectly cooked and nice and dry. The smoked duck breast was so good, some said it almost tasted like ham. The squash pur√©e with pomegranates was a strange combination, however they surprisingly complimented each other extremely well. Bronzino- a very light yet savory sauce with potatoes, onions, and the cutest little clams. The fish was cooked perfectly, but be careful of all of the bones! Dessert: Chocolate pot- A very light, creamy chocolate mousse incorporated with candied almonds and topped with creme fraiche is how I'd best describe this dish. The rich chocolatey flavor complimented the texture of this dish very nicely.",8,7,8,9

1855,24030,655,9/27/10,"Oh my, oh my, oh my.   I've been going to this place for years and years -- pretty much since I figured out that the subway is not, as my mother says, where you will surely die.  I haven't been for a long time, up until this summer when I decided to head back and see if it should still be raved about to everyone I know.   It should still be raved about to everyone I know.   This place is authentic northern italian food.  The waitstaff is made up of the SAME people it was when I first started going, which either means that it's a family establishment, or that it's a great place to work, or both.  The menu is also the same, but that doesn't bother me in the slightest, since I was dreaming of the spaghetti with basil and fresh mozzarella all the way there on the train.   We got grilled calamari to start.  It's the only place I've ever been to that has grilled calamari at all, and wow is it delicious.  Some people get calamari just because it's fried, and they think that frying anything will cover up the fact that they're eating squid and a little freaked out about it.  But here, there's no bells, whistles, sauce, or breadcrumbs.  Just plain grilled calamari and a lemon.   I got homemade pasta for dinner, and I almost cried.  That's what I say when the food is really good.  But sometimes, it happens.  The freshness was off the charts, the smoky flavor of the mushrooms, and the salty cheese and sauce made me wish that I was at olive garden, and the plate was the never ending pasta bowl.  Except that olive garden could never, ever, do pasta like Malatesta.   I wish I remembered what dessert was like, or if we got any, but I was so intoxicated by dinner and the atmosphere, and so very full, that we stumbled out after a surprisingly inexpensive meal, and smoked a cigarette like you would after sex in a movie.  And yes, it was that good.",9,9,9,9

I'm so glad we actually came early because once 5:45PM came, the whole place was filled up with a long waiting list. Phew* lucky us! We ordered the shrimp & pork buns and kimchi ramen. Shrimp buns were really good but the pork, which I thought was not that great. It tasted kind of weird. The kimchi ramen was savory, a bit spicy and very filling. I forgot to mention, the noodles were al dente! Yes! Love the chewiness! Good thing we were warned beforehand to mix the soup base because there were tiny pieces of grounded pork on the very bottom (Thanks Bonnie).

Maybe it is just because I found the dumplings to be too flavorful and fatty.  I must admit the dumplings had the most soup that I have ever seen inside a xiao long bao, but the soup got sickening.  After a few I would bite the skin, and pour the soup out into a bowl. Eventuall I started only eating the skin and tossing the meat as well.  The scallion pancake was good, but a little too doughy than what I am use to.  Joe's Shanghai was a cheap meal compared to other eats in NYC, but I still wouldn't choose to revisit this establishment.

The aioli was unlike any other I've had, though I'll admit I don't eat enough Greek food. It had some bite, so the tzatziki was a perfect, cooling accompaniment.

Sure, the ambience was nice, service was a little overbearing but with good intentions - but if an Italian restaurant is touting its homemade pastas, they better not be mushy. The bread appetizer was nice. Bread was fresh and tasty. I ordered the saffron risotto balls - it was tasty, sort of, but it was kind of unwieldy and the sauce tasted just like the risotto balls - tomatoey and vaguely seafoody. I had the gnocchi with proscuitto, and my boyfriend had the lobster mac and cheese. The gnocchi was very disappointing. It was way too soft, and stuck to each other relentlessly. They were also a little too big for my liking. The sauce was nondescript. Vaguely tangy tomato based sauce with indeterminate vegetable things and proscuitto shreds. The lobster mac and cheese was slightly better. But something about all the sauces we had that night tasted like it came out of a can. The lobster mac and cheese sauce was strongly reminiscent of seafood chowder or the like. I like Max's pastas way better. Malatesta's spinach gnocchi is the best I've had so far too.",4,7,3,9

Our plates were cleared with perfect timing and the next courses were presented before we were left wanting. 2. Food was spectacular.  The Oxtail and Foie Gras Terrine and Roasted Bone Marrow were the quintessential perfect starters for our meal.  The special Braised Short Ribs and Pied de Porc Pane were equally decadent and thoroughly appreciated.

They were passing out wine to those waiting so I didn't really mind.  As soon as my party got there we were seated. The complimentary bread they give out was pretty delicious which sucked for me because I didn't want to to eat it but at the same time I devoured it. We ordered a Greek salad, and pork loin (or whatever the pork appetizer is) to start. We asked for the feta on the side and in turn we got two huge blocks of feta that we're devoured with the delicious bread I didn't want to eat. I didn't have the pork but was told it was delicious. For our entrees we got the lamb chops, sea bass, red snapper, and Mediterranean dorado and one of each side. Everything really was delicious, the fish tasted fresh and was beautifully meaty! I topped my fish with fresh squeezed lemon and got in there with my hands- there was no stopping me. We got delicious creamy Greek yogurt with cherries for dessert (complimentary) and sat and chatted to our heart's content (until we could move without toppling over).

You can walk up and be greeted by the owner who is so very proud to stamp and wrap up your purchase.  I ordered the chocolate butter cream brownie and it came with instructions on how soon to get it to a refridgerator if I was going to be out long and a good red wine to go with it.

That made the meal very tasty. The next week, I ordered the same plate with Kimchi. I love Kimchi and I wish they'd add a lot more too. The week after that, I wanted to Teriyaki chicken but they said it would take them an enormous amount of time. I inquired about the several other options available. I asked about the Spicy Pork instead of the Beef Bulgogi. The man at the counter gave me a sample taste of the pork. It tasted good, so I asked for it. There was a minutiae of brown fried rice left if any, so I opted for the white rice. He put the Teriyaki sauce on it , which aided the rice in tasting better. The Teriyaki chicken is $5, while the Spicy Pork and Beef Bulgogi was $6. An extra dollar doesn't bother me. The quality of the food is good. I loved both of the food. The Kimchi is my side to eat it with. I buy this food every Thursday since my hours in school are long. It's really good. P.S.  they only put small amounts of meat on the tacos and gyros.

In the dog-eat-dog world of restaurants it's very rare for patrons to be contacted about their concerns or complaints. For that, I have decided to edit my review and raise my rating from 3 stars to 4. I will also revisit this restaurant again; I truly did enjoy the food here and appreciate that my concerns were addressed and hopefully corrected. I prefer my brunch without a side of snobiness, that's why I gave this place three stars when I really wanted to give it four. I went here on a Saturday to meet some friends for brunch, and when our party unexpectedly went from four people to six, our waiter made sure to give a loud noticeable sigh to show his annoyance (even though the place was empty). The food however unlike the atmosphere is exceptional. Like the decor the food is rustic and simple with very clean flavors. I had the challa french toast with berry compote and a side of Canadian bacon. The french toast was very decadent yet light. I also had a pear drink that was very good (pureed pear and Prosecco). Everyone at my table enjoyed their meal and raved about the food but they were very critical about the less than stellar service. I love the decor here, I felt like I was in a little chateau somewhere in Sicily. The servings are well portioned and I think the menu has great options for everyone (one of my friends is vegan and was able to find something).

1899,7369,414,10/14/12,"On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese, I FOUND my poor meat ball on Stanton street. Tuesday night, table for 6, 45min turned into 23. Survice: The host was very friendly, kept up with us in terms of when our table would be available. The first waiter who gave us our water seemed to have a lot of attitude, but our main waiter was very nice and chill. We sat outside in and experienced the wonderful night of NYC. Dish: Meatball smash with the daily special and spicy sauce. Today's special was a pizza meatball, very tasteful, taste exactly like pizza and the spicy sauce topped it off with flavor! I didn't know what to expect, but it came in a meatball burger! pizza + burger in 1 mmmMMMmmm. Dish 2: Meatball sliders, spicy pork with spicy sauce and chicken with pesto. I thought these dishes were OK...NOTHING ALL THAT SPECIAL. It wasn't tasteful, but not as tasteful as I would like liked, more bland. I tried the regular beef meatball and I thought it had more flavor.   The best part.....MINT ICE CREAM!- if anything this is by far the best mint ice cream i've ever had. Although their dishes were alright to me, this ice cream was BOMB.com. This is a MUST! its not your typical mint...its light but strong enough to have that mint taste, with mini mint leaf chunks. Over all experience: prepare fot the wait and if anything GET THE MINT ICE CREAM!",6,1,5,5

All of the servers we've had have been spot-on; nice flow and instinct about when/how often to come around to our table. Cassandra is a doll. I love the outdoor and indoor seating areas: lots of wood furniture, christmas-style string lights, and mix matched decor that just works in a weird way. Prices are certainly a little bit too much for most things, but I can't deny that I love how Roberta's uses ingredients that they grow themselves.

I think it's better they spend a bit on Restaurant Week so people like me will be impressed and suggest their restaurant to others looking for a real great food restaurant not just it's reputation.  Now, I'm afraid to spend the $$$$ high end for fear it will have the same non-impressive menu but for more $$$$. After all, isn't restaurant week a sort of advertising? I'm not very impressed. The only impressive part is the location and ambience.  But I can recommend other spots for Restaurant Week to be impressed with. I don't know if I will be back. I can't eat the ambience.

1908,76348,247,4/13/13,"Disclaimer: I studied in Japan for 4 months. I didn't eat ramen every day, and I don't claim to be an expert, but this does at least allow me to compare ramen to what I ate in its country of origin. Additionally, a fun fact: going out to eat by yourself in NYC drastically reduces your wait time. I went to Ippudo at 7pm Monday night, and only waited 10 minutes to be seated. The decor is definitely more modern, but beneath that is an undercurrent of a ramen house. There are booths along the sides, and in the main space are large tables for 10-12 people. I sat with a number of strangers, who were already engrossed in their meals. The smell was great, and the staff were all shouting in Japanese as customers were seated. You can see the cooks behind a counter working in teams to fill orders, and I recommend taking a look if you're sitting nearby. I was conflicted between trying a more traditional dish (since this was my first time here) or eating their BBQ pork special. Luckily, the special runs until June, so I asked for the Akamaru Modern (a pork bowl with miso paste) with kakuni (braised pork belly). The meal far exceeded my expectations. The broth was delicious without being too salty, a common occurrence for ramen shops (and common complaint from customers). The pork was tender and flavorful, and ordering the kakuni was clearly the right idea as I finished the main pork very quickly. The noodles were light and soft without being mushy, and the greens were amazing. It's the first time I wished there'd been a few more greens in my ramen. I planned ahead of time to eat the noodles quickly so I could get the second helping (a call of ""kae-dama"" will get you more noodles if you have enough broth remaining), but it turns out I didn't need to plan at all. While the broth was great, I devoured my noodles quickly, taking more time with the second serving and my remaining pork and veggies to enjoy it all with the soup. Final verdict: I have some fond memories of eating ramen in Japan. I think most Westerners who get to visit look forward to their first Japanese ramen and built the experience up in their memories. With that in mind, I can easily say that Ippudo's ramen was as good, and quite possibly better than, the best ramen I had in Japan. As a caveat, I couldn't use Yelp at the time to find the best ramen in Tokyo or Osaka, but I definitely believe Ippudo ranks up there with the best of them. I haven't visited Totto Ramen or some of the other popular ramen places in NYC yet, but if any somehow blow Ippudo away, I'll revisit this review. As long as I list this as 5 stars, know that Ippudo remains king as far as my palate is concerned.",3,6,3,4
1909,18747,625,2/12/11,"1) A dimly lit, bordering on narrow space with somewhat eclectic interior design. It felt cozy. 2) Initial lack of hospitality by the hostesses.. (I used to be a hostess, so I really hate this in restaurants). But our waitress and other servers sort of made up for it with their enthusiasm and constant water pouring. 3) Braised Rabbit Legs- a bit too salty. The meat was cooked perfectly, but it was sodium overload. Spicy Duck Meatballs- I kind of thought this was.. bland. In spite of the raves over them (which is why I wanted them in the first place). They were more minty than spicy. 4) Grilled Prime Creekstone Hanger Steak- I was really expecting to devour this, but again.. the creamed spinach that was under the meat was too salty. The steak was cooked medium rare just how I love it, but I can't eat meat on it's own, so in its entirety, the dish was too salty. However my boyfriend ordered the Roasted Duck Breast- which tasted really amazing. I was super jealous. 5) I wanted the choc souffle, but being the noob I am, I didn't think to pre-order it since it apparently takes 20 min to bake. We did order the Gingerbread Cake which I wanted also. It was my favorite part of the meal. I devoured it. The cake was the perfect moist texture for gingerbread and I wish it came with a pint size of the creme fraiche ice cream (because I LOVE IT). Overall I've learned that I have difficulty appreciating expensive meals, I really love dessert no matter what, and that I should have ordered the Organic Chicken instead from the restaurant week menu.",5,6,6,6

When i asked the hostess if there were seats at the bar open she glanced over and told me no. Well- i found my own and made people push over. I also got a glass of wine which the bartender never asked me if I wanted another glass, yet asked all the locals around me if they did. He acted like i didn't exist. Its hard to be from out of town and go to a bar/restaurant and be alone and he didn't help. I got a trio of Meze's- the tzaiki was watery and the beet and regular hummus was fine.

1916,158629,247,1/15/12,"To what lengths will people go for Ippudo's firm, flavorful ramen? A couple visiting from Boston in December told me they'd arrived in New York on a Friday, a day earlier than their last visit, so they'd be sure to get in. They'd missed out in their previous attempt. Neither a hyped Japanese brasserie nor a revived ramen craze brought this effort. Originally from Japan, the two had eaten in the island nation's Ippudo restaurants, which number 43; they were fans intent on eating at the New York branch. It is with similar determination that Ippudo's local patrons wait in the lounge to be seated in the East Village hot spot that spills out into the street at night and can command 20-minute waits at lunchtime. Reservations are not taken. Reasons to keep returning despite the crowds: * Arguably the best ramen in New York City. My favorites: Tori Ramen and Shiromaru Hakata Classic. (Ippudo was ranked #2 in January 2012 in the Village Voice's ""NYC's 10 Best Bowls of Ramen."") * Culinary adventures such as the shishito peppers appetizer. Each jalapeno-like, lightly fried pepper surprises with a taste that can be mild or hot or killer. Diners can indulge in two taste sensations beyond the peppers themselves -- a squeeze of lemon and a dip into yuzu salt. * Eclectic musical soundtracks that sometimes reach back to the 1970s and 1980s. * A wide variety of sake that stops short of being overwhelming. * The chance for a solo diner to be seated immediately at the communal tables or the mostly dinner counter, despite a big crowd. * Interesting conversations with strangers at the communal tables, like the one I shared with the Japanese natives.",6,9,6,9

Towards the end of my meal when they were clearing the plates on the table behind me I had to stand for 5 minutes to wait until they were done. Cute but not worth the discomfort of eating with my neighbor's elbow in my face. We waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2, not bad at all. As far as I can tell there's no sign up list - just talk to the host/waiter and he'll magically figure it out in his head. My friend had the beef hash with poached eggs and siracha hollandaise, and I tried the croque monsieur to get something other than eggs benedict for once. I took a few bites of the beef hash and it is really good! The siracha sauce on top gives the eggs and the hash a nice kick and the hash is nice and crispy with slightly burned potatoes. My croque monsieur was wayyyyyy too rich and cheesy and buttery, I couldn't even finish it. (In fact I lost my leftovers somewhere in Bloomingdale where we went shopping afterwards). The side potatoes were also better at Jane. We also tried a chocolate croissant; it was standard. Would have loved to try a pear tart.

I'm not the biggest fan of their bbq sauce, but my boyfriend loves it. Wings are solid, mac and cheese is delicious and the Sunday brunch is a godsend for lazy days when Enid's just seems too far.

In fact, Sakagura is my place of choice for any special occasion. You can imagine that I was really excited to go to Robataya right next door to Sobaya in Bon Yagi's little Japan Town freakin' empire. The whole shtick behind Robataya is simply grilled food with great ingredients. It's Japanese, of course, and has a pretty extensive menu of seafood, vegetables, etc. You can see where this is going right? I'm with the posters below that were like, ""wth, this is bland,"" or something to that effect. I'm even more surprised at this reaction since... I don't think that of any of his other restaurants. Even Soba... which I was skeptical that I would want to eat outisde of my own kitchen (or my mom's), when I went to Sobaya, all the food was delicious, balanced, and SOLID. And you know what? It's not as if I was like, ""did I order the right thing?"" I mean, I had the 8 course ($50) tasting menu. If the ""right thing"" isn't in the tasting menu, then I don't know where it would be hiding. It filled me up and it tried to be interesting... but most of the time, I was just like, ""?!"" The first course was 3 slices of fluke, some spring brocolli with fish sauce (not thai, but a creamy house glaze), and some uni floating in some gelatin. The fluke was fine, but the moistness of the combu it was on... it was hard to eat... came apart (it was sashimi) and stuck to the thing. It was pretty badly executed. The uni was good, but the gelatin was completely bland. I had some with soy sauce. There was no indication of what to use for what. There was a side of delicious salt. I guess. The second course was tuna, hamachi and white tuna... one piece each. It was fresh and good, although the tuna wasn't an amazing fatty cut or anything. The third course was shredded/pulled beef in a daikon beef broth with a piece of daikon. I really liked this. The broth was really good. NOT BLAND. And the beef was good, if a little tough. The daikon was cooked well with great flavor. Not bitter at all. The fourth course was the vegetable plate with eringi (king trumpet), eggplant, and shishito peppers. The veggies were grilled to perfection. The mushroom was yummy, but just seasoned and cooked w/ butter. In fact, it's kind of exactly what my mother and I do. But I LOVE eringi mushrooms, so I am not complaining. The shishito was hot and delicious. I tried a small piece of the eggplant, which was soft and tender... since I am technically allergic. The fifth dish was a rather large piece of tsukune (ground chicken meatballs) and grilled beef. The ""kobe beef"" wasn't the tenderest of kobe beefs I've had. It was kind of hard, but it was pink on the inside and the flavor was good. The tsukune was tasty enough. My SO thought the tsukune/chicken was gamey. It was full of onion. (It doesn't beat Yakitori Totto, though.) The sixth course was the fish and rice, which was a lot of food. The mackeral was dry enough that I doubted it was a mackerel at first. Haha. The rice was quality with salmon roe and steamed salmon. My issue with the rice, though, is that I LOVE getting the salmon and salmon roe rice at Sakagura and this dish is NO WAY NEAR as good or transcendent as that dish. Why? I don't get it. I wouldn't even mind if they did the same exact thing, honestly. I just want something good. The rice was good, but it didn't nearly have enough ikuras in it. THE MISO SOUP WAS BLAND. I expect that at other Japanese restaurants, but again... Sakagura's red miso soup is DELICIOUS. This time here, they use white miso and the thing is bland bland bland. And the fish was BLAND. I put some salt on it... and it was ok, but mackarel needs to be oilier than this fish was... The final course was the desert. I got the Shiratama with green tea ice... although that's not what it is called in the menu... my memory is failing me now. The thing is, this dish only came with two shiratama pieces in a full bowl of sweet cold soup. I wasn't impressed, but this was my SO's favorite thing about the meal, I think. I think anything at Cha-An would have kicked this desert's ass, though. Sigh, and I guess the point is I was disappointed. I was surprised and disappointed. The food was bland. I understand the salt here is PREMIUM, but no. My mind is really confused, reconciling this place with Bon Yagi's other places. This simply isn't the same standard I've come to expect. The food is filling, but nothing I would ever really come back for again.",4,6,4,6
1936,104800,625,9/11/12,"Had dinner here with my wife for our anniversary. We did the tasting and it was amazing! I think i enjoyed every course. of course there were a few stand outs. like the duck meatballs that everyone is raving about... with good reason! also the Tuna tartar was done very nicely, having a variety of textures and flavors that made it really fun to eat. The meal ended with a chocolate souffle that was done perfectly. This was probably one of the most overall enjoyable meals i had in my life. of course the fact that i was with my beautiful wife on our special occasion multiplied the experience greatly. but even if that had not been the case the food itself was enough to make Perilla a 5 star review.",7,5,7,5

1938,58491,251,4/4/10,"BOTTOM LINE: Order them pork buns already, no, order two! Cost: -$30-50/head for lunch (tax and tip included) Atmosphere/Decor: -Minimalist, clean lines with wood accents, and a vintage Johnny Mac poster.  NIce. Ordered: 1. Pork buns: Forget the prix fixe; order TWO orders of this (four buns), and you're good to go! The white, fluffy taco-shaped bun pocketing three succulent cuts of pork belly was the closest thing I've had to a religious moment. 2. Crispy skate: Delicious and tasty. Crispy one one side, fleshy on the other, and topped with aged, caramelized lemon slices and greens on the side.   3. Cured hamachi: Disappointing and expensive. The hamachi didn't seem fresh and had a mushy texture.  Furthermore, the taste was also significantly overpowered by the salty seaweed and rice puffs sprinkled heavily on top.   4. Grapefruit cream pie: Refreshing and tasty. Service: -Sat at the bar during a non-peak hours and found the staff friendly, attentive, and helpful.   -Flipping through David Chang's book entertained me whilst waiting for the food. Conclusion: -Order them pork buns!  Order the prix fixe if you want some affordable variety, but stay away from the cured hamachi.  Looking forward to trying the bo ss√§m as per the other glowing reviews.",6,6,7,6
1939,84985,416,1/17/11,"We came here on the night of the big Christmas Snow and there was still a 45 minute wait... not a problem because we could found a place near the bar and had a drink. We were seated pretty quickly by a very friendly host. The place is tight and I think they try to cram one or two more tables than comfortable and if you are too close to a steam pipe, it can be uncomfortable. The menu looked good. I asked the server for recommendations and clarification (I don't know what a ""hen in a basket"" is) and she seemed kinda bothered by a few questions. I figured it was a true food lovers hang out and the servers would love to talk about the menu. We had a couple drinks which were fairly small for the price, but really good. We started off with the brussel sprouts. These were overcooked with too much carmelization. I had the pork belly, which I normally love. This had not been cooked long enough and was tough and chewy. The fat layer too thick and rubbery. The flavor was there and was outstanding, but the execution was not. My wife had the gnudi. It had a weird film on the exterior. The gnudi was kind of bland. I was not overly impressed with this place and it was not worth the wait.  The prices were a bit ridiculous too.",3,6,2,6

And you can take your leftovers home (sideeye to Ippudo #imstillmadoverhalfabowloframen).  They have a veggie option that sounds like it won't be as tasty as the other options but ohmygad it's so delicious.  The soft boiled egg breaks open and makes the dish so rich and satisfying.  Their appetizers are also REALLY good.  The kale salad and brussels sprouts will turn the most meat-loving trendy-vegetable-hating person into a kale and brussels sprouts fiend.

It seems wintry Monday nights are the time to go, as there was zero line-up (despite being relatively jammed indoors). We went pepperoni, mushroom and extra sauce, and the lattermost is highly recommended, as they seem to prefer a dryer pie than we do. I can't recommend Grimaldi's highly enough.

Cool, they call tzatziki ""white sauce"", whatever.  Got two dishes, one with freaking lamb (YUCK!!!) and one with chicken. The dishes were odd in that they looked and kinda smelled the same.Also, one set of utensils for both of us. I elected not to eat. Hubby loved the food however he became ill several hours later.

1945,84984,416,1/23/11,"On a Sunday before a Monday holiday, a friend and I randomly wandered up to NYC from Philadelphia, in part because my friend wanted to check out The Spotted Pig. And really - is there a better reason for a random road trip than good food and drink?! In any case, we arrived at The Spotted Pig a bit on the later side for dinner, I want to say around 10:00pm. But there was no rush as the kitchen doesn't close till 2am. We didn't have a reservation and there was a little bit of a wait - maybe 15 minutes or so - until we were seated. And the place was full - but not overwhelmingly so. The first floor features a compact bar with a small dining room. The second floor offers more tables, another bar and is a bit more spacious - that's where we were seated. The place is warm, cozy and chock full of various pig things - no surprise there. Low lighting and a very relaxed feel - intimate, but with great energy. Groups maneuvered in and out with little difficulty despite the small space. We split the burger and my companion was rather delighted that every available surface of the bun was toasted. The accompanying shoestring fries were addictive. Before that we went a bit devious and ordered the Deviled Eggs AND the Devils on Hoseback (bacon wrapped oysters), which were polished off in very short order. And the gnudi - heavenly little dumplings filled with ricotta - is a must. I'm salivating just thinking about the dish. There are no words to describe the extent of the melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. As for beverages, he ordered a few beers and I stuck with the Pimm's Cup -  pleasant reminder of my time spent in England. We lingered comfortably over our meal and drinks till about 1:30ish and I'll def make a point to go back next time I'm in NYC. Solid gastropub experience.",8,7,8,7

1949,12048,61,11/20/08,"Thank you, thank you, thank you to my colleague who took us on a hike down to Broome Street (from Hester) on our 45 minute lunch break, so we could pick up the Despana sandwiches we pre-ordered.  I walked into the place and I knew it was special.  I'm sure I've passed it a bunch and didn't even notice it but, ladies and gents, pay attention!  I guess in New York it's easy to leave stones unturned, but you better flip them over if you want to find some gems.   So, if you haven't guessed, the theme of the place is:  Spain.  Myriad exotic and infused olive oils are out to sample and a comprehensive collection of Spanish cheeses are on display (including the awesome Roncal that I learned about in my Murray's Cheese class).  Every individual ingredient available at Espana is quality and together in something like..hmm... say the Quijote sandwich....they sing a fresh and lovely song.  My sandwich involved some type of pressed pork, but i reminded me of a cross between a pastrami and a salami.   It was different than any pork I've been familiar with.  Also,there was an excellent cheese (that  I now forget  the name of) and a sweet quince paste.  The bread was soft and it was coated in that layer of flour that lets you know it's fresh out the oven.   So this shop is a MUST try for a great quality sandwich and it's also excellent for any foodies who want to buy cooking ingredients, items for a cheese plate or gifts for a friend who is crafty in the kitchen.",7,6,7,6

Well, after we finished eating at the other restaurant, we decided to grab a second dinner!  Yes, immediately after our first dinner!  Needless to say, we felt like we were going to explode afterwards.   With that in mind, we still thought it was worth it to stop by.  We of course had the pork buns, which were delicious as always.  The slightly sweet and soft white bun with the perfect combination of lettuce and mouthwatering pork!  Their broth for their ramen has an incredible depth of flavor. The service has been good every time I came here.  I just love this place!",9,8,7,8
1951,10433,903,12/10/10,"After checking out an art gallery opening way west on 27th Street I had been planning on grabbing dinner at the Half King before noticing this trendy restaurant teeming with people. Signs in the window indicated that it's Michelin recommended AND people love it on Yelp. My companion and I said, sure! We both enjoy wine and were pleased with the extensive wine list. A nice bottle of Sangiovese knocked us back $55 but there are definitely less expensive (as well as more expensive) options and wines by the glass. Everything looked great. We were tempted by the bruchetta and pizza cones but instead opted for the grilled asparagus appetizer (covered in slices of asiago and drizzled with balsamic) and buffala with tomato and basil, as well as two 8 inch pies: the Campana (mozzarella, tomato sauce, cherry tomatoes, parmigiano and basil) and the Ortolana (with zucchini, eggplant and mushrooms). Yeah, we ate quite a bit... Since Ovest has a brick oven in the back I was pretty excited to try their pizzas and I was not disappointed. The crusts were chewy and very slightly charred, just like at Roberta's. I'd say that Roberta's had more flavor overall though; the Ortolana was good but could have used some spice! I would have been satisfied without dessert but it was insisted that we try the nutella pizza. Instead I was thinking, oh man, not another pizza! I would have tried their zeppolis instead. Sure enough it was an entire additional 8"" pizza pie slathered with nutella and powdered sugar. Mmm, sure, but it was a little too much bread for one evening for me. Service was fine. Slightly ignored as the evening wore on and more and more people came in, but we were also in a corner. One thing that really stood out was when the wine was opened the waitress sniffed the cork to make sure the bottle was good. That is such a nice and necessary touch when ordering a good bottle of wine! This is a nice spot for grabbing a nice glass of wine and a bite if you want to splurge a bit in far west Chelsea.",7,6,6,7

1954,44063,160,5/19/13,"Contrary to belief, I'm a simple guy. I tend to live a minimalist lifestyle, I dress plainly, I love all things Apple, my favorite color is navy blue, my car is a barebones manual civic, the list goes on... My pizza toppings tend to echo that sentiment. So when my friend told me that this place had just a handful of pizzas to choose from I said, ""that just means they know their shit and don't distract customers with other bull."" Honest to God, this was the best pizza I've had in my life. Granted I just got off the plane at Newark and hopped on the NJ transit to catch two more trains to get to Brooklyn, but still. We ordered the Neapolitan meatballs, $9; the Sopressata Picante pizza, $15, and a pinot noir for my friend, while I sipped on a couple of their craft cocktail special--i don't remember what it was called but it had all things Jesus told us to stay away from. Basically, it was fucking delicious. The meatballs are simple. It's kind of hard to mess these up, yet it is also hard to get them to amazeballs status. I felt these weren't quite there, but they were damn good. I think the oregano could have been upped to bring in that authentic mama's house kind of feel to them. Their fork tender nature and moist interior was hard to say ""no"" to, especially since my stomach had been eating itself for the past 7 hours. The sopressata picante is a purest's dream. The original pepperoni pizza. Fresh tomato, fior di latte (a pretentious name for a creamier cow's milk mozzarella), garlic, and olive oil. The flavors evoke cleanliness, freshness, and a feeling of authenticity you don't find common in pizza joints. It's definitely the oven that creates this magic, and it's what you see when you enter the restaurant. The thing I love about these brick ovens, is that they only get better with age. That in itself will keep me coming back on my future visits to Crown Heights. These two dishes were great together...one was relatively heavy (meatballs) while the pizza was a light delight. We capped off our night with an off-the-menu treat called the Banana Nutella Calzone a la mode with Dulce de Leche gelato and a pinch of sea salt. Let that shit sink in a bit. *cue Yelp bookmarks ""To Try""* Made, in the same oven as their other delicious commodities, this is a huge pocket filled with the amazingness known as nutella spread, with slices of banana, then baked to a puffy cloud of a dessert. It looks big, and it is, but it is perfect for sharing and is on the lighter side (just like their pizzas). We took it a step farther and made it gelato a la mode with a perfect dulce de leche cream. Our handsome waiter, Peter, suggested the sea salt on the side and that seriously made my night. He knew where we were going with this before we did. There's something about that sweet + salty formula that equals pure ecstasy in your mouth. Good job, man! With alcohol, our bill came out to $90, which was a great way to start this weekend of eating!",8,2,9,9
1955,64602,752,2/25/08,"This place is what made me end a 12 year stint as a vegetarian. My friends from SF decided to pay me a visit in NYC shortly after I moved there.  One of them wanted to go to Amy Ruth's because he saw it featured on the Food Network.  There was a ridiculous line, but, luckily, there was a table open for three, so we were able to get seated right away.  Lesson of the day: do NOT go there after people are just getting out of church.  This is a big after-church place. My friend ordered honey dipped fried chicken.  Yes.  You read that right.  After eyeing it on my friend's plate, I asked if I could have a piece of honey golden fried goodness chicken skin.  My sides were good (fried okra, sweet potatoes and grits), but oh my LORD I wanted that chicken. I had a bite.  The floodgates opened, thus ending my 12 years as a vegetarian.

1961,8680,242,12/3/14,"The wait is finally over. As the months past I continued to salivate over every minuscule piece of news I would hear about Mu Ramen. I was able to visit their pop-up some time ago and dubbed it my favorite ramen place in the city. Does their shiny new brick and mortar hold up to those lofty standards? We arrived at Mu Ramen 15 minutes before opening due to hearing of the 45 minute wait the previous day. We were seated right away and opted to sit at the counter. Always a treat to watch them make your food. That being said, the main dining table was beautifully done. The garden of succulents in the middle was creative touch. We started out with the UniPo, which co-owner Heidy called an update to their U+I dish. Uni mixed with porridge topped with salmon roe and white truffle flakes. Delicious dish complimented by huge flakes of truffle. That being said, I do find the U+I a much more enjoyable dish and will probably be ordering that going forward. Or both if I can help it. The dish didn't come with any spoons, so we awkwardly tried to eat it with our chopsticks. After failing miserably we asked for spoons, which they waitstaff realized it should have already came with. Next was the Tebasaki Gyoza. Foie gras stuffed chicken wings. You would think that this dish would stop your heart in one bite considering the rich ingredients, but this is where Chef Joshua Smookler shows much restraint. The chicken skin was lightly breaded and in no way oily. The foie gras enhanced the taste of the chicken and did not over power it. My friend and I both decided on two different ramens. She got their trademark Mu Ramen, while I opted for what I had previously, the spicy miso. While both ramens' broths were both delicious and unique in their own way, the Mu Ramen's broth was like nothing I never had before in my life. Composed of oxtail and bone marrow, the broth was so hearty and savory yet not overly salted. Add in huge chunks of brisket, and I was particularly jealous. The spicy miso still is the best spicy miso I've ever had, but I will be sure to order the mu ramen next go. Decadent and inventive, Mu Ramen is the result of a chef with such a high caliber resume given free reign over Japanese comfort food. Smookler's ramen is one of the most creative I've seen without deviating so far from the tradition, but his creativity doesn't cease there as the small plates are even more astounding. The world of ramen just got shook.",8,6,8,6

Shared a table which is a nice way to meet people and have them take pictures. haha.",9,5,5,6

1978,26992,84,4/14/14,"Antonioni's some how achieves the perfect combo of homey and cool without being boring or pretentious. We sat at the 2 person round table in the corner with the banquette- the best in my opinion for two because it's comfortable and you get a nice view of the restaurant. The host, bartender, and servers are all extremely hospitable. It was a Sunday night and it was pretty quiet, maybe because the place is still relatively new and undiscovered? The food- we ordered the Pappardelle Sausage and Fennel and Spaghetti with Manila Clams. Both were delicious! The Pappardelle was especially tasty and zesty. The ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly. Definitely coming back to try the other dishes on the menu. There is also a fancy cocktail menu for fancy occasions. The bartender seems very capable and whipped up two great drinks. A great new addition to the neighborhood.",9,7,7,8
1979,149321,842,4/2/14,"Delicious zutto pork belly bun. Tasty tonkatsu broth with yummy chasu, but could be creamier and noodles were slightly soft and clumpy. Duck and seafood ramen looked great but tasted just okay. Excellent atmosphere and service.",7,3,6,5
1980,3576,258,8/12/11,This place is the best. I lived around the corner from them when they first opened. I could not get off the subway without stopping there. Unbelievable food. I now live in Queens but am always willing to make the trip out there!,9,6,7,4
1981,77662,374,10/25/12,I have not had a taco here I haven't liked - they are all great. Not traditional mexican fare - but awesome deliciousness! I go for lunch about once a week.,9,7,9,7

1983,51322,808,10/30/13,"Holy unexpected heaven. One of the best dinners I've had in a while. The kind of dinner where we were both obnoxiously mmm'ing the whole damn time. I knew going in that it would be good because the reviews were so good but god damn. We did the restaurant week menu that was $40 for an appetizer, an entree, a dessert and a glass of wine. To start, we had salmon ceviche and short rib arepas. Both were incredible. For entrees, we had the short rib and the suckling pig. Again, both incredible. The meat was out of control and the entire execution was perfect. For dessert, we had the churros and flan. Yep, goes without saying. F'ing tasty. It's important also to note that unlike most restaurant week menus, everything was full menu size. So, it was an amazing value, especially considering they gave us gigantic pours of any wine on the menu we wanted. Lastly, the service was that of a top notch restaurant. The perfect amount of service that is there at every corner but at a level you don't even notice. Friendly, efficient, perfecto. I've already thought of at least five people I need to take there now to show it off.",9,8,9,8
1984,16682,211,12/4/09,"Still awesome, still tasty as hell, still Artichoke. Not much to say, it's the same, as it should be, but I just want to quickly say some things that are new with Artichoke. 2 doors down, Led Zeppole, a small property that is owned by the Artichoke crew seems to be almost done. Building looks done, there's a new shiny sign atop the property, hopefully it will be just as awesome. Of course, zeppoles & games & any other things that remind me of Coney Island cuisine is already awesome in my book. Also, Artichoke is opening a new branch of Artichoke pizza quite soon, sometime early next year. 17th Street & 10th Ave, nightclub central. This is from articles I have read and from a flyer inside Artichoke. Hell of a business decision & I am sure will be successful as hell. It is going to be very different, it will have seats inside up to 200 seats, it will have a security guard & has a curfew for alcohol. Stops at 1:30AM on weekdays & 4AM on weekends because that's what the  Community Board wanted. Awe-some: [aw-suhm]: adj; inspiring awe, very impressive, Artichoke Pizza.",9,9,9,9
1985,24616,851,9/27/12,I'm not going to fall out of line with the overall average rating for this place!  I love their coffee and unfortunately tried the iced latte (vs. the iced coffee) and I can't go back!  It is super strong and wakes me up in the morning.   I have had their sandwiches and don't understand why people say this place is expensive!  It is super cheap and huge portions.   I would have given 5 stars but they aren't open on Sundays (when i want 30 iced lattes) and cash only.,7,7,7,7
1986,4717,651,11/23/10,"I sometimes forget that foods I've grown up with and consider typical are unfamiliar to others. Such is the case with the fishball.  The fishball is much like our beloved meatball except, as the name implies, it is made with fish.  Savory yet mild, I'd recommend giving it a chance if you haven't already.  A few years ago, I discovered the Fuzhou fishball, which is stuffed with pork.  Meat stuffed with meat? Sign me up!  There are only a few places in Chinatown that serve it, and I am determined to try them all.  First up was Super Taste - with a name like that, expectations are high. But how did its Fuzhou fishball measure up? Super Taste is located in the non-touristy area of Chinatown - that is, pass Canal Street Chinatown, go under the overpass, keep walking, and THEN you're there.  The restaurant features hand-pulled noodles, stewed meats, and other Fuzhou delights, but I was here on a mission - how did its fish balls in broth measure up? For $3, you get 10 golf ball sized fish balls in a savory beef broth (you can add noodles for extra).  The fishballs were light and fluffy, with juicy pork meat hidden within. The broth was better than most, with a rich beefy flavor.  For $3, this dish really can't be beat. Super Taste isn't the most convenient restaurant to get to, and you can grab one of it's 3 tables if you're lucky.  The wait staff, consisting of one woman, can be a bit gruff; however, if you're willing to forgo some ambiance for a cheap and savory meal, I'd recommend Super Taste. A little out of the way, but worth it for the price.",7,6,7,8

1988,2909,100,12/8/10,"Ever wish you can turn back time and do things differently. Well this is a clear case where I wish I would have came here 5 hours earlier for brunch instead of dinner becuase I think the experience would have been much different. Needless to say, this restaurant was pretty adorable and surprisingly they own up to their mistake by offering us a free drink when our reservation was messed up. Feeling a 'lil fiesta, I ordered the jalape√±o margarita, but it wasn't spicy at all, so that was pretty much a failure (whomp, whomp). After waiting for about 1 hours and feeling pretty buzzed, we all were seated (8ppl). The waitress was accommodating enough to bring us separate checked. (That was pretty cool) Everything was going well, until my food arrived. I ended up ordering crab cake and I always find it insulting when crab cake are made of crab rib instead of crab lumps. It is even more insulting when they use a icecream scooper to scoop it and then bread it tightly with panko to be deep fried (yuck)  I also sampled some of the other food and it wasn't stunning. If it wasn't for the people that I was having dinner with, who made me laugh my butt off, this restaurant would have gotten 2 stars instead of 3. But then again,I shouldn't make a big deal out of it since it's just food right...???",3,6,4,6
1989,87655,454,8/11/08,"I LOVE this place...the food was great. We had the mac & cheese and all I can say is that it was sooo yummy. Every thing is cool about this place, even down to the design of the menus. Our waiter was very sweet and had us laughing all night. You haven't experienced life until you've tried out Cafeteria!",8,8,9,7
1990,2001,521,4/5/14,"It was perfectly fine pizza, but I'm not sure about the hype. I think it's endearing that the owner still makes the pizza and cuts basil on to the fresh pies himself. And it might be blasphemous for me to say this, but I liken the pies to Grimaldi's or Lombardi's. Slightly soppy pizza  due to the toppings (maybe it was our bad to get the pie with toppings vs just plain cheese). Would I wait the 2 hours again? Definitely not. Would I eat it if it was presented in front of me? Definitely. Save yourself the wait. Mooch of someone else who did the waiting for you. Disclaimer: I am not a pizza connoisseur. Pizza comes in three categories to me - crispy and delicious, or soggy and nice, or chewy and meh. This pizza was soggy and nice.",7,6,6,6
1991,85630,419,8/14/14,The food here is good. By cost definition it is definitely worth it. You get what you pay for. I would say price is around same as chipotle. The people here aren't as nice though and it can only hold 10 people. It's fast and cheap enough.,7,6,7,5
1992,75107,468,12/29/10,"This place is too overrated. Got to Chinatown, and into Joe's Shanghai for their ""famous"" soup dumplings. They were OK, but not worth any wait or any bragging. Half of our dumplings popped before we could even drink the soup. The pork dumpling tasted a bit like liverwurst, I don't know. Just to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.",1,9,4,9

The breakroom fries are the BOMB and the fish tacos were good too but it was pricey for a small taco. Will definitely come back for the fries tho.",8,6,6,6
1995,24336,78,4/26/07,"Probably had one of the top 2 porterhouse steaks in the nation here.  Oddly the two best steak places i've been to are both in NYC.  First off they give you huge gianormous portions!  I never tried anything else but the porterhouse steak it is that good.  It is tender, and has a light olive oil dressing on it.  Juicy, tender, yummy!! Service was pretty good for such a busy place. The place can get busy on weekends so be ready to wait.",7,6,7,7
1996,88406,443,7/17/14,"Delicious, fresh and carefully prepared food, served by friendly French people. The menu changes daily based on seasonal market availability.  The chef is meticulous and treats each plate with care and attention to detail. I had the market salad, fresh seared fish with corn and tomatoes. The hanger steak with frites might be common but in the hands of this chef, it is memorable. Those frites are fried in duck fat, crispy on the outside and soft within. Yum. The menu contains some  adventurous selections and the desert selections are also tasty. The young french owners are making a go of this place in the iconic former home of the beloved Zucco, who ran his Le French Diner successfully for years. If you loved Zucco, you owe it to yourself to give this new version a try before the lines form out the door.",8,7,8,6
1997,7776,27,3/6/13,"This place is great. A perfect and tasty vegetarian eatery, one block over from where I used to work. It is a delight to go there whenever I pass through the neighborhood. The falafels are fantastic, and the reclosable packaging is very innovative, and makes for a good way of doing take-out. I would definitely go out of my way to take lunch here. They've got some wonderful and creative combinations.",8,6,8,6
1998,22754,345,8/29/14,"Overall a great place. The snacks are sized for a single person appetizer (My girlfriend and I split the pond wings, it was two fairly small legs) with the small plates definitely being portioned to share (The grilled squid was faaaaaaantastic!). I got the Phork Chop, and my girlfriend got the Flank. Both were delicious in their own right, but the Phork Chop with the peanut sauce was out of this world. The summer rolls were a little bland, but the rest of the dish more than made up for it. Service was fantastic - very laid back attitude, but very professional attentiveness. Five stars for the wait staff. Here's the only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars. Dessert. There's no dessert menu, and your choices are the Fois Gras Doughnut (I still can't see how this is appetizing to people) or a frozen snickers bar. We went with the snickers ice cream bar expecting something ""deconstructed"" or similarly complex. Nope. It's a snickers ice cream bar. Like the kind you get from the vending machine. They cut it into four pieces with the wrapper on and serve it with strawberries and powdered sugar (powdered over the wrapper). If it didn't only cost $3 I'd be a little more upset, but given what it was and the cost, it's a little comical. Overall would definitely come back and recommend to friends, but maybe skip dessert and head next door to Dynaco for an after-dinner drink and piece of cake =)",9,6,7,4
1999,15147,662,2/21/12,OMG G-O-O-D!!! I have to give credit where credit is due....this place is a real gem in Queens! The Korean BBQ wraps and the Truffled Beet Salad are examples of true oral pleasures!,9,9,9,9
