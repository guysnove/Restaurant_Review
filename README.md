# Restaurant_Review
# This projet analyzes the reviews of different restaurants using different machine leaening algorithms. We used clustering algorithm to find how words are grouped based on their similarities, and we used classification models to predict whether a future review would be negative or positive.  We also did a basic sentiment analysis on the reviews.
